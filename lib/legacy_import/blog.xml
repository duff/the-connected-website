<content:encoded><![CDATA[While TCR has become something of an accepted shorthand for The Connected Republic, to me it also stands for three related themes, perhaps differently defined here; namely Trust, Confidence and Renewal.  Beyond the simple definitions of these words and the generally carefree way in which they are sometimes tossed about in both the private and public sectors, the words reach far more deeply into the leadership demands and challenges inherent in rising to the revolution that "The Connected Republic 2.0" so aptly characterizes.  

Simply put, Trust, Confidence and Renewal are at the core of the public sector's ability to realize a new relationship with stakeholders (stakeholders being broadly defined as citizens, businesses, employees, officials and immigrants/visitors).  Even today, some folks (no matter who they represent) will ask whether a new relationship is needed or perhaps worse, whether the terms of reference for it should come from somewhere else.  They don't ask such questions out of ignorance or a lack of motivation, they ask because in the past they've heard (and acted on) such strident fluffery, only to see incremental change if any.  Can we continue to exercise our perceived right to "wait it out"?  Sure we can, but increasingly the question is, at what cost and to whom?   

In a connection that some might find something of a non sequitur, the truly global advent of the internet and the real separation of capitalism from democracy, has combined to create a fundamental shift in the way stakeholders view their governments and the importance those governments have on their lives.  Governments may still be expected to provide services to stakeholders, but what is their abiding role? Does it matter?

I think that the answers to these and all of the questions they give rise to are important, but if they're answered without the underpinnings of Trust, Confidence and Renewal, how useful are they?
<h1>Are Networks the Wave of the Future?</h1>
<h2>by Paul G. Thomas</h2>
<p>Networks are the hot concept in the fields of public policy and public management today. The recent annual conference of the Institute of Public Administration of Canada in Winnipeg was based on the theme “Making Connections.” The opening keynote speaker was William D. Eggers, co-author of the widely praised book <em>Governing by Network: The New Shape of the Public Sector.</em> Many other academics and consultants have adopted the concept of networks to analyze the changing contours of the public sector and forecast fundamental changes for public sector leaders, both elected politicians and career public servants. Governments are also jumping on the network bandwagon by incorporating the concept into descriptions of their roles and the practices they follow. The premise for all of this talk, and, to a lesser extent action, is that new networked organizational forms are supposedly supplanting traditional, administrative hierarchies and that improved governance, enhanced performance, and even a better quality of life will be the result.

This article sounds a cautionary note. Our breathless enthusiasm for networks is leading to rampant speculation about the transformational potential of the concept without a careful definition and reliable knowledge about what has actually happened up to now. Not for the first time, the field of public management is being swept along by a fashionable idea and by predictions that it will have revolutionary impacts on how governments envisage and conduct their activities.

The fact that previous fads have not lived up to the hype that preceded them is being ignored. Instead, celebrity authors, consultants and some government spokespersons are rushing to the premature conclusion that networks are rapidly displacing economic markets and administrative hierarchies as the two main bases for interaction, direction setting and organizing for change within society.

I am not rejecting the network concept. It clearly has both theoretical and practical value. Rather I am calling for more clarity and precision in its use, more modesty about the advantages of networks and greater acknowledgement of the potential drawbacks of these types of arrangements for improving governance and the quality of service provided to citizens.

Adoption of the network metaphor refers to the growing interaction and collaborative problem solving between governments and other sectors in society, including businesses, not-for-profits, social enterprises and community-based organizations. There is no disputing that governments today are involved in a wider range of outside relationships with other parties. These patterns reflect the greater insistence within a more pluralistic and less deferential society that governments consult more widely on policy initiatives and generally demonstrate greater responsiveness to changing conditions and demands arising from their external environments. Doubtful about their own democratic credentials, governments have increasingly sought public input into policy formulation. Criticisms of large, public bureaucracies as inefficient and ineffective have also pushed governments into the wider use of third parties to deliver programs and services.

The cumulative impact of these trends is to find governments relying less upon top-down policy-making and program delivery through the traditional integrated department. Instead, they are involved in a more extensive, kaleidoscopic web of horizontal, inter-organizational relationships involving shared power, shared risks and shared accountability.

Use of the network metaphor to describe these new arrangements is popular for a number of reasons. First, the network idea sounds modern and positive compared to the old bureaucratic paradigm, which sounds negative and outdated. Second, the network metaphor reflects the prevailing and future reliance upon information and communications technologies (ICTs) to generate and distribute information and knowledge needed to enhance organizational productivity and performance. In contrast, the bureaucratic model is said to belong to a bygone industrial age.

Supposedly, ICTs enable governments to draw instantaneously on the expertise of other sectors of society, to engage citizens more extensively and more meaningfully and to improve their own operations, including monitoring the performance of third parties who have been delegated public authority and public money to deliver public programs. The glittering potential of the ICT revolution has clearly changed the thinking, vocabulary and the practices of governments.

Recognizing the public relations value of positive words, governments have adopted phases like integrated governance, joined-up government, horizontal policy-making and management, collaboration and public-private partnerships. “Governance,” which is a decentralized process of dispersed power, is said to be in tension with, and increasingly replacing, traditional “governing” in which power is concentrated in the office of the prime minister. In the governance model, governments are no longer seen at the apex of society controlling the change process on the basis of a top-down approach. Instead, more often they react to the initiatives of others, orchestrate the interaction of various stakeholders to seek a consensus and depend increasingly on outside organizations to actually deliver programs. In working with others on the basis of shifting networked relationships, governments are no longer in charge like they used to be. They rely less on legislation, regulations, and binding administrative actions. Instead, they provide “soft guidance” to other actors within society.

I want to challenge the growing pervasiveness of the network model on both theoretical and empirical grounds. First, by suggesting that networks are rapidly displacing administrative hierarchies as the main basis for how governments conduct their activities, we are lapsing again into the use of simplistic dichotomies, which do not accurately capture the complexities of governing under modern conditions. Also, debates about the future of the public sector based upon dichotomies tend to polarize and distort participants’ viewpoints. They lead to labelling some approaches as all bad and others as all good, which is unfortunate.

The complex and diverse universe of organizations and processes involved with the governing processes today cannot be neatly divided into two categories: public versus private or networks versus bureaucracies. It makes more sense to think in terms of hybrids and on-going transitions, not pure types and overnight transformations. Networking is hardly brand new; it has always been part of the repertoire of behaviours of politicians and public servants, especially in a federal country like Canada where the three orders of government have collaborated in the design and delivery of programs for decades.

Probably networking is more extensive today than in the past, but a lack of agreement on a definition makes this difficult to state with precision. Do public-private partnerships, contracting out, horizontal policy-making, service integration and other emerging activities, all constitute types of networks? Within the traditional departments, there has been a growing use of devolved decision-making, task forces, work groups and earned autonomy. Do these trends mean that networking is taking place within the boundaries of the much-maligned old-style bureaucracies?

Presumably not all networks are the same and the goal should be to develop a typology of such entities, along with guidance to public sector leaders about when to employ the network mode of interaction. Unfortunately, at this stage we know little about the origins of particular networks, how they are established, how agendas are set within them, how their internal dynamics change over time, how they are led and managed, how success is defined and measured, and how they are modified or terminated when performance fails to meet expectations or targets. Most networks involve extra work, entail additional risks and blurred accountability.

At some point, we may be in a position to provide reasonably reliable advice to decision-makers about when the presumed benefits (increased support, improved outcomes, money saved, etc) of a particular network will exceed its costs, but the knowledge foundation for such prescriptions does not exist today.

The popularity of the network model has reinforced the long-standing and simplistic dichotomy between leaders and managers, which is based mainly on research involving private firms. Leaders are said to be visionary, bold, entrepreneurial, risk-taking and innovative, whereas managers are technocratic, cautious, risk-averse and resistant to change. But, in the public sector, the picture is complicated by the fact that leadership is shared and overlapping between elected politicians who are accountable to the public and appointed career public servants who are answerable to their political masters. Political pressures and constraints have always operated within public organizations, at times being felt all the way down to the front lines. In the so-called network era, exposure to outside influences presumably becomes much greater.

It is not clear at this point how the traditional roles ascribed to politicians and public servants are changing based on more extensive networking. To what extent is political involvement needed to initiate, manage and modify networks? Are the leadership competencies in terms of knowledge and skills of political and administrative leaders converging as a more congested, interdependent and interconnected world puts a premium on strategic thinking, communication, consensus building, conflict management, negotiation and risk assessment?

It is easy to exaggerate the way that the day-to-day work of public managers has changed as a result of greater networking activity. In conducting relations with outside organizations, public managers represent their “home” departments and still have to perform their regular duties within the administrative hierarchy, including adherence to all the rules and procedures. Moreover, with the move to more devolved and cross-departmental activity, managers will already have become more experienced at working in less rigid and more horizontal settings.

Some valuable evidence that networks are not so radically different from dreaded bureaucracies can be found in Robert Agranoff’s new book <em>Managing Within Networks,</em> which presents fourteen case studies of networks in various policy fields in the US. He describes networks as “self-managed collaborarchies” in which public managers draw on their experience in their increasingly open, knowledge-seeking bureaucracies. Management in the collaborarchy is thus simultaneously similar to and different from management in hierarchical organizations.

If we believe the gurus, networking will become the way that most governing is conducted in the 21st century. Put me down in the Doubting Thomas column. We need more clarity about what constitutes a network. We need to avoid dubious dichotomies and glib prescriptions about what will work. Before we lapse into easy generalizations about when and how to use a networked approach, we need more practical, usable knowledge and less dazzling speculation about the future. Governments have spent too much time, effort and money in the past searching for “the one best way” to enhance their performance. Networks are never likely to completely replace old-fashioned bureaucracies in which public servants will continue to do most of their work and to which they will return after those days when they have spent time “outside” networking with other organizations and actors.

Bureaucracy is a persistent organizational form with legendary survival skills. Bureacracies will continue to be relied upon because they represent stability, controllability and predictability – attributes that allow for political direction and democratic accountability. Public servants – whether we call them leaders, managers or the quaint, old fashioned term “administrators” – will engage in more networking activities and will need to diversify their repertoire of behaviours. However, the POSDCORB skills (that snappy acronym from the 1930s) of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting and budgeting will continue to be crucial.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown is down but not out and there are signs of a recovery. Conservative Party leader David Cameron, having tickled voters' interest, has hit a glass ceiling. Both sides engage in trench warfare but neither breaks through. Politics is in a no man's land.

Today politics is struggling to come to terms with great changes: more assertive citizens, more diverse societies and more globalised economies. Together they call for new ideas, particularly a new relationship between the state and the citizen. As yet that call goes unheeded.

From the mid-19th century, state power grew - rightly - to guarantee clean water, safe streets and legal rights. In Britain, it culminated in the post-World War II Attlee government's nationalisation program and the welfare state.

By the last quarter of the 20th century, however, it was clear that too much state could be as bad as too little. Governments had a poor record of picking industrial winners but losers had developed a consistent habit of picking governments. Thatcherite reforms moved power from state to market. Blairite reforms have again shifted power from the state to new institutions. But neither Thatcherism nor Blairism moved power from the state to the individual.

This post-Blair agenda is the bridge needed to close the growing gap between politics and public. Membership of British political parties has halved in just 25 years, but we are not alone in witnessing record levels of cynicism about politics.

Across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, average election turnout has fallen by 10per cent. Yet with half of Britons now volunteering, public involvement in civil society is increasing, not diminishing.

It seems people aren't so much turned off by politics as the way politics is done. Public disengagement is a symptom of disempowerment. Too often we shut people out when we should be letting them in.

Such a shift is in keeping with the spirit of the times. Faced with forces that feel beyond control, people are taking refuge in what they know: their families, communities, local identities. Ordinary consumers are getting a taste for greater power. But while people may have become more empowered as consumers, they feel disempowered as citizens.

Ours remains a "them and us" political system, framed in an era of elitism. Rulers ruled and the ruled were grateful.

Economic advance and universal education - and now the internet - are sweeping aside deference and ignorance. Representative democracy from the past century can evolve to a more participatory democracy in this.

Modern challenges, such as the environment, cannot be solved by government alone any more than a solitary state can bring about better health or lower crime. They require the citizen as well as the state. Governments that nationalise responsibility and make competence their yardstick risk finding they lack the levers to put right the things that are wrong. Progress in the future depends on sharing responsibility and power.

Equity demands empowerment. Despite rising living standards and falling poverty under Labour, a deep inequality gap still scars Britain. Through many decades social mobility has slowed down. The growing gap between those with skills and those without is partly to blame, but addressing inequality is not just about money. As Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen notes, people suffer social, educational and cultural - as well as economic - disadvantage. Breaking this cycle means moving beyond the traditional welfare state solution of retrospectively correcting the symptoms of inequality, like low wages and family poverty, towards a pro-active assault on the roots of disadvantage. Real equality of opportunity means giving people real control over their lives and a fairer share in power.

None of this suggests the state has no role. Global warming and global terror, economic uncertainty and mass migration make for insecure times. People want to know they are not alone. But they want also to control their own destiny. So the modern state has to step forward where citizens individually are weak - providing collective security and opportunity - but step back where citizens individually are strong, exercising personal choice and responsibility.

The modern state should not just enable. It should empower so that more people can realise their individual aspirations to progress. The Right wrongly rejects the state. The trick is to transform it so that the state controls less and empowers more.

It is time to complete the post-war journey from Attleeism through Thatcherism to Blairism, from the state being in charge to the state empowering the citizen to be in charge, from "they control" to "we control".

This narrative should run through government policy like a stick of rock. So in economic policy the siren voices of protectionism and interventionism would be ignored. Tax policy should help create more wealth, not penalise, particularly when it comes to those on low or middle incomes. And wealth should be democratised by extending employee share ownership and home ownership far beyond present modest government proposals.

Next, the choice agenda in public services - most desired by the most disadvantaged - would be universalised. With record numbers of parents seething because they cannot get their child into their preferred school, they need more than sympathy. They need power. So the government should give parents - starting with the poorest, who are usually stuck with the worst schools - their own budgets to make school choice real, not rhetorical. In old age, health, child care or training, individuals should be able to control budgets to make the choices that are right for them. The same applies to communities. Minimum standards would be set nationally that local services could exceed locally. Councils and their funding should be freed from much central government control. Local police and health services would be directly elected. Local communities would have a bigger say in local courts and could run local parks and childcare centres.

Of course, no one willingly gives away power, so the public service should be capped. Civil servant numbers in Britain have been reduced but still total almost 500,000.

My ministerial experience taught me that the bigger the machine, the more it will do. So the civil service should be reduced by one-quarter. This change would symbolise the state running less, not more, and place a new principle at the heart of our governance: one of subsidiarity, where power is relocated to the lowest possible level.

<title>The Next Big Thing</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been thinking recently about when we are going to see the big breakthrough in the search for the much-expected transformation in the business of governing. It was partly prompted by a discussion I facilitated with government people from New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the OECD about “government 2.0”. Part of the discussion included a video link to Wellington, where we spoke with a group of high school students who have been working with Wellington City Council about how young people wanted to connect with government.

I think the big changes we’re expecting – maybe unrealistically – will only occur when two things happen. The first will be the day when a majority of senior policy makers, politicians and others who would define themselves as influential mainstream policy decision-makers and influencers “get it” about the role and potential of networked information and communication technologies. The minute a genuine critical mass of those types, who typically have views about technology ranging from agnostic to hostile, realise that in order for them to have any chance of securing the big policy outcomes they are chasing – sustainability, learning and skills, rescuing health systems from the cost-demand-technology crunch, helping people out of poverty and so on – they will need to embrace the potential of networked technologies, we’ll start to see real progress.

The second sign that a breakthrough will have happened is when governments spend as much time worrying about how to use these technologies in the service of opening up the democratic conversation as they do (when they worry about it at all) about improving the efficiency, reach and convenience of public services. The problem, of course, is there is a great deal less motivation for politicians to worry about the former than there is about the latter. But there is growing evidence that for ordinary citizens, grateful though they always are for any incremental improvement in the design and delivery of public services is concerned, their enduring focus is on the nature of the relationships they have, or often don’t have, with those who claim to represent them. I was especially struck by what the Wellington students kept coming back to with themes like these:
<ul>
	<li>Respect me regardless of age, ethnicity, knowledge</li>
	<li>We’re going to be the ones living in the communities</li>
	<li>I want to shape my world; I need to have a voice and need to feel I’m being listened to</li>
</ul>
And they had some direct and practical advice to politicians…you have to open up to criticism, be prepared to engage in real discussion, stop broadcasting messages and start having conversations.

I’m more and more convinced that it will be the combination of these two changes – making the debate about technology mainstream and investing more time and effort in the transformation of representation – that will drive the breakthrough we’re seeking. Until then – and I’m pretty sure we’re a fair way off that moment in most of the jurisdictions I know – the whole discussion about the transformative potential of technology in politics and government still feels peripheral.

For the most part, we are still talking with a relatively small group of technologists and occasional enthusiasts whose position in the public policy process remains peripheral. To be perhaps a little unfair, we spend too much time talking to ourselves, reinforcing our own enthusiasms and passion for the broader eGovernment project but, too often, unable to convince sufficient numbers of the really important players that it’s a passion they ought to be sharing.

Maybe we should take up a suggestion that one of the participants in the workshop put forward, to put together a kind of Government 2.0 ‘exhibition’ that you could take into shopping centres, schools etc to actually show people some of the simple but effective ways that technology could help citizens connect better with their governments and their representatives. Let them try it for themselves and see what all the fuss is about…iff we want real transformation, maybe we have to work a but harder at showing people what it’s all about.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>I am a bit sceptical about how different the next generation are - haven't young people been saying this sort of thing at least since the 70's? What I find more interesting is when citizens go off and do things with Web 2.0 technologies and government then has to catch up. I think  government does begin to get it when it sees how people can use some of these technologies to empower themselves.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Perfect response!  Couldn't agree more, but my sense is that not too many governments do get it and don't even recognise they are already falling behind.</wp:comment_content>

A the Government Computing event earlier this year. William Heath put together an exhibition and it is here

http://www.thepublicoffice.org.uk/

This was a series of five case studies that showed how challenging people found it to interact with the UK government.

Your earlier commenter points out that it is interesting when people go off and do it for themselves to show government the lead. One issue for the case studies is that for them, leading often extremely challenging lives, there is no space to go off and be different. The odds are stacked against them and what they need is a service provider that will open up and change the service to suit them. The service taker simply does not have the means to build something different as they are struggling just to stay afloat as they system and its complex requirements bears down on them.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Fair point, but even if people are time-poor, harassed and generally not in a position to find the time and resources to go off and 'do it for themselves', they will still likely be responsive to attempts by those more responsive service providers to offer some sort of opportunity for service users to offer their ideas about how best to make the services more aligned to their needs.  it's a question of degree, perhaps - not everyone will be in a position to co-create but everyone is in a position to be engaged in the process of reforming services in ways that reflect their circumstances.   Even a little bit of engagement with clients, even if it doesn't reflect the full theoretical approach, is better than none.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just finished a fascinating 3 days in Phuket, Thailand at a government and technology conference.  There were speakers from all over Asia offering fascinating insights into the astonishing ambition and scope of the eGovernment agenda in this part of the world.  And an amazing array, too, of different stages of development and progress. 

There was lots of talk about new collaborative approaches to improving citizen service, which meant government agencies had to work out better ways not just to collaborate between each other but with a whole lot of other players outside government.  Which raises tricky questions about the quality of the data that gets generated and stored.  Who will set the standards to make sure all of those different players can rely on the data they need and share?  Who owns the data?  Who gets to take responsibility if the data is incorrect or faulty in some way? 

Wonder if the concern about data quality and ownership is partly a smokescreen to disguise a deeper resistance to playing the collaboraiton game?  Perhaps that's unfair.  But there's a risk, maybe, that while we're sorting out the details of data ownership and quality, the collaboration bandwagon will roll on through the new opportunities of social networking.

The ownership thing is interesting too.  I think who owns the data is much less important than who has access to it and under what conditions. The power of ownership as a proxy for control is  diminishing...I think.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>I'm reminded of the first time I met Cisco's Simon Willis at a Unisys gig on Money Laundering he was hosting (fresh out of the Treasury) at the Unisys campus in St Paul de Vence, France (very nice).

One of the contributors - Hamish Pringle , ex Saatchi, from memory - had commissioned a UK survey of who people trusted with their data.

The EU was last (25% ish trusted), UK government next last (about 40%); Microsoft, maybe 50%; Marks &amp; Spencer came second best at &gt; 60% and step up the winner : Boots the Chemist got over 80% trust rating.

My long held view is that the requirement is for a "Custodian" "Identity Foundation" funded by businesses and institutions collectively and cooperatively on a "Not for loss" basis to "own" data as "trustee".

This ties in with Simon's brilliant 10 minute conclusion/ summing up of the gig which was to the effect that while every other activity or application may or may not require payment, it is the payment/ clearing function - uniquely - which requires Identity.

He went up even more in my estimation when these words of wisdom turned up in Pole Position in the next day's Financial Times.

I thought then... "this man will go far"....!</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>You're right, Chris, he is brilliant and he has gone far...

Two ideas...the first is that the best custodians of personal data are the people about whom that data is created.  The second is that, if we either can't or don't want to take on that responsibility directly, it is a role that could be taken on by civil society - basically, non-government organisations whose stock-in-trade is trust.  Maybe that is what an Identity Foundation is?  My sense is that this is a job for a wide range of organisations prepared to take on the role of identity custodian.  The worst thing would be to create another monolith, even if it was a nonprofit monolith.  The basic principle should be competition and choice amongst potential identity custodians.  

IBSG Public Sector is about to release a draft white paper dealing with exactly this issue, with a central focus on three interdependent ideas - risk, control and acountability...more to come soon.</wp:comment_content>

<title>Nurturing Talent</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve just come away from a meeting where we shared our thinking about connected health, education, government, safety and security and so on in the emerging markets. I was struck by the type and strength of opinion held by the audience over the future of education compared to the other areas.  It is clear that many people see education as underperforming, in need of reform and in particular the need to change the teacher into a coach and the see only the learner as the centre of attention. I am disturbed to see such widely held views that suggest a)  that education systems are falling apart (everywhere) and b) a frustration that education isn’t improving and can’t change quickly enough. To me, these comments implicitly undermine the role of the educator and I am totally and completely sure, even when the learner is the centre of attention, that we need to nurture the all educator talent as it will, in a connected world, be even more important for the development of education to meet the needs of the economy and society today. I wish I could move the debate away from a simplistic faith in learner centricity to a new understanding of educator effectiveness.  More than a year  ago in Kenya I saw a teacher running a class on the reproduction system. Using on-line content with her class of 60 they all worked with amazing enthusiasm as a class, in groups and as individuals. The learners were clearly learning, they were happy and interacting in a way they were not in other teachers’ classes.  Virginia had had her talent developed through some Cisco led training but she had designed the lesson herself and she was now away on her path to being a different type of teacher. I have seen Virginia a number of times since that lesson in Nairobi and at Heathrow primary school last month. She has transformed- she is a new type of connected educator and her students now have better opportunities and are learning more. (See <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/education/schools/article3091583.ece" target="_blank">http://news.independent.co.uk/education/schools/article3091583.ece</a> for trip of UK teacher back to same project) So this works, but how do we scale?  Virginia is <strong><em>the</em></strong> local talent and probably now knows more much than her trainer!  Perhaps we  should enable her to coach others and nurture even more talent so that we can build  localized improvement in educational effectiveness.   I think I need to find a “connected coach virus”- that can spread amongst teachers- nurture and grow talent- that’s the thing.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>As always a really powerful observation by Jim about the connected educator. But also I think it important that we avoid a false oppostion between learner centricity and educator effectiveness. We need both. Using its Next Practice programme the UK based Innovation Unit is encouraging practitioner led innovation and developing its thinking on user voice.

Jim is right though to urge that the pace of reform in education needs to be unrelenting.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I agree but it's an interesting insight into a debate that seems riven by these simple dichotomies - we need more focus on learners or more focus on effetive educators, as if these two things are mutually exclusive.  Mike is right - the temper of these Web 2.0 times is very much about how users and producers forge new combinations to create insight, impact and effectiveness.  In way , the kind of divides that Jim is highlighting are symptomatic of an era that is rapidly fading.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A challenge...when you look around at what is being done in eGovernment around the world, do you get the impression that we're seeing a lot of change but not much transformation?  We're making things faster, smarter, more convenient, cheaper, more integrated - or at least some of these things some of the time and even a few of them all together.  But are we really witnessing 'transformation', that is, change that ushers in a new state of being, a truly new way of doing the business of government?  Do we use the 'transformation' word too loosely in the eGovernment debate?  Maybe some of the frustration and even disappointment about the progress of eGovernment is a function of the "overpromise and underdeliver" syndrome.  Or is that being too harsh and unfair?  I wonder whether, at this stage of the eGovernment project, it would be interesting to spark something of a stock take of what we've achieved so far and how we ought to be describing what we're aiming to achieve into the future.  Is it really 'transformation' and, if so, what do we think that really means?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Times New Roman">Today's thoughts- spurred on by Martin and Mike.  Literally no issue in education is exclusive of any other and, I think significantly, a small change in one area can have a massive impact on another- just think how group work impacts assessment methodology, for example. The butterfly effect is alive and well in education! Transformation is never achieved overnight, it is the result of continuous incremental change and it is the relative weight that Government and the education community put on each dimension of change that makes the difference to the speed of adoption and transformation. Importantly, Ian Gibson makes the point that moment of transformation can’t be spotted it has to be lived- over time. But the point which has worried me for many years is that whenever sweeping statements around major reform areas are made- such as “let us move to a student centric world”, the potential for undermining the science of learning and teaching - to the uninitiated – is seeded due to the simplicity of the message. So, the principle reason why I want to promote the notion of nurturing talent is to 1) celebrate success and raise the status of <strong>educator talent</strong> as a consequence, and 2) spread the good news from educators that have already managed to make the links between the important factors to the general education population. Surely the simple fact is that change happens when peer success leads to mass adoption nothing else.</font>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've found myself refering to Nancy Foy and <em>Foy's Law</em> over the last few days in various conversations and as I've been quoting her for years I thought it worth sharing here- I think she was way ahead of her time and the first part of this quote could be a very early insight into  why social networking is effective and "official" attempts less so.  Look at the date of her work!

<em>"<strong>The effectiveness of a network is inversely proportional to its formality</strong>. It needs a spider not a chairman, a list of members, not a set of by-laws, groups not committees and a phone number rather than a building"</em>

<wp:comment_content>Lovely - this is exactly the import of a great paper by NokiaUK marketing director Will Harris on the rise of the mobile 'super users'.  His point is that the super users, who live and thrive on the mobile phone, are exactly the kind of informal, social, not-committee types that Foy's law predicted.  And the point Harris makes is that it is these people whose values and behaviour are proving to be corrosive to many of the traditions of hierarchical institutions and systems.</wp:comment_content>

<title>What&#8217;s holding Enterprise 2.0 back?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I came across a couple of interesting presentations - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/slgavin/meet-charlie-what-is-enterprise20">meet Charlie</a> and <a href="http://theshed2.wordpress.com/2007/08/20/meet-charlotte/">meet Charlotte</a> -  which I enjoyed but which made me think. The Enterprise 2.0 vision they describe is attractive, but it seems to me is only happening very slowly whether you are in the private sector or in the public sector. Why is this? The most obvious explanation (as ever) is culture - fully embracing these tools involves a willingness to be open - which is quite a radical shift for most people myself included.

The immediate group I work in has about thirty to forty people in it and from a collaboration point of view it would be great if we could easily Google each other's desktops, but how many in the group would sign up to that option if it was available? Or suppose we all started sharing our work activities via regular blogs open to all. Won't people start grandstanding - adding material to look good to the boss and spending a lot of effort on their entries because looking good sometimes seems almost as important as doing good?

I also think that the range of Web 2.0 tools for work still needs to progress a bit. People are generally pretty busy and so the tools need to make minimal demands on the community. Take a fairly simple form of collaboration - bookmark sharing. If every member of the community has to manually share their bookmarks, take-up will be low. But if you had a tool that automatically harvested any new bookmarks and then enabled the user (perhaps once a week) to batch process them for addition to the community collection, take-up would probably be much higher.

Overall, I think that as the tools improve so too will attitudes and behaviour. Bit by bit people will find that being open is not so bad. And perhaps choices will become less stark - the tools will enable more differentiated forms of sharing, so we can be open as it were without feeling exposed.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>I think that you will get all sorts of behaviours to this new public world, grandstanding, lurking and so on but these behaviours are all so new that  different rules and acceptable actions inside these new interactions are being built just as quickly as the technology is enabling new ways to interact - what seems to be interesting is that the less formal interactions are grabbing the order of the day and what is acceptable is changing quickly. In particular,  what is acceptable and unacceptable is a challenge to the older generations' perception of social order.  But as John Chambers said in India recently, TIME magzine got it wrong- it isn't the age of the YOU it is the age of the US.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>The biggest challenge of this phase of the 'live' web is the need to assess but not to judge, or at least not too quickly.  By that I mean the need for some patience and openness (to use an appropriate word) which will avoid the risk of rushing to judge and dismiss certain experiments and, with them, some of the underlying values to which they are attempting to give effect.  As Jim says, this is all very new and we're pretty much making it up as we go along.  The occasional inevitable crash doesn't render the entire endeavour less worthy or potentially valuable.</wp:comment_content>

<title>Is Mobile Government (or m-Government) Inevitable?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been looking for a good book on m-Government for some time now and I finally found one - Mobile Government: An Emerging Direction in E-Government, by Ibrahim Kushchu. It provides many examples of m-Government from various countries in terms of technology, applications and services. It’s also one of the few books I’ve come across that provides m-Government examples from developed countries and those nations in economic transition.

Kushchu argues that while e-Government was an important step taken by many governments, service delivery through mobile technologies (things like cell phones and PDAs) is now inevitable. While I agree that many countries will experiment with and provide some government services using mobile technologies, I believe the extent of m-Government deployment will vary greatly from country to country. Not unlike with e-Government, m-Government will depend in large measure on the circumstances in each country and government’s ability to see the future and execute.

In other words, I don’t necessarily agree that it is inevitable. Public demand for mobility and the efficiency and productivity gains of the public sector through mobility will help lead the move toward m-Government. It will then be up to individual governments to understand the opportunities presented by mobile technologies and to act on them.

To illustrate the point: I believe a strong case can be made for providing government services via mobile devices in South Africa where the cell phone penetration rate is remarkably high (and the Internet connectivity rate is relatively low). Offering services via cell phones represents a promising avenue for the country. It will improve service delivery generally (added convenience and flexibility), provide access to government services to a larger number of people, save the government money, etc. To date there aren’t that many examples of m-Government in South Africa. Why? Because the government does not currently have a good handle on the needs and wants of its citizens and it has not yet developed an m-Government strategy - either as a separate strategy, or as part of a broader next generation e-Government effort. Work is currently underway to move South Africa’s e-Government efforts to the next level of maturity, but the specific role of m-Government has yet to be determined.

As I read the book, I couldn’t help but think of the many potential applications of mobile technology in many developing countries where I have been working recently. Examples include: public health (sending a message via short message service (SMS) to an AIDS patient to remind them to take their medicine); public safety (sending a mass alert to registered citizens via SMS in the event of an emergency); agriculture (providing market information, commodity and input prices, weather reports, etc. to farmers); and e-billing (paying electricity bills or taxes using a mobile device). These applications would really help improve peoples’ lives.

Kushchu’s book has certainly helped me to look at m-Government differently. In addition to introducing me to leading m-Government technologies, applications and services from across the world, it has also helped reinforce my view that m-Government may well form the cornerstone of a successful service delivery strategy in many countries. It will be useful to me in my work and I recommend it to others interested in the topic.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I went to Headstar's excellent e-Democracy 07 conference. The final session had three UK politicians (Andrew Miller, Theresa May and Ed Davey) giving their thoughts on e-democracy. Not surprisingly, they were strongly focussed on the use of Web 2.0 by politicians, political parties and representative assemblies and all three of them made clear that they wanted to embrace these tools. None of them of them, however, seemed to have much sense of the real transformational possibility of Web 2.0. There was very little sense of the scope for opening up all sorts of decisions to public scrutiny and public involvement. It was much more a case of - how can some of these tools give a bit of a boost to our existing democratic processes? Not surprising but it does show there is still a huge amount of work to do in getting people to see the real possibilities of a connected world.

More generally, the conference was a lively event, but there seemed to be quite a lot of ambiguity about what e-democracy really was and could deliver. Professor Stephen Coleman made a typically challenging speech where he called for more e-democracy projects that involved real deliberation and generally more rigorous analysis of the impact different e-democracy projects had had. Interestingly, he wondered whether a key aspect of e-democracy was really citizen-citizen rather than citizen-government. In other words (if I understood him rightly!), projects should be aiming to get citizens interested and talking to each other rather than holding out the illusory possibility that they can interact with government on an individual basis. The most obvious UK examples of Web 2.0 in government are things like the <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/">No 10 petition site</a> and <a href="http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/blogs/david_miliband/">David Milliband's blog</a>, but I tend to agree with Coleman and think they are a transitional phenomena. The real future are sites that - with or without government support - bring citizens together to discuss and take action on public issues. That, of course, and the much wider issue of moving to a public sector culture of openness and feedback the like of which has never been seen!]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>I want to strongly endorse Coleman's suggestion that citizen-to-citizen is huge area for development. The key is to craft citizen-to-citizen participation online among politicians and governments so they can be indirectly and sometimes directly influenced. That is the approach we take with Issues Forums at E-Democracy.Org.

<wp:comment_content>I'm not sure the political blogs will be so transient.  I like Milliband's blog.  I also read with interest the blog on the FCO's blog aggregator from the outgoing British Ambassador ro Afghanistan, a heartfelt, lucid and very direct (for a diplomat!) account of a particuarly significant place and time.  If we want these new tools to create a greater sense of immediacy and intimacy, then I think they work well, at their best.  I see that as an enduring and not a passing ingredient in the overall eDemocracy mix.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As David Wilcox <a href="http://www.designingforcivilsociety.org/2007/11/two-views-on-e-.html">mentions</a>, there were some fairly polarised views on the value of e-petitions at e-Democracy 07. In particular, the No 10 Downing Street e-petition site came in for some criticism. The arguments against were: 1) the site allows no deliberation 2) the petitions have no clear impact and it is not clear who (if anyone) pays attention to them 3)  there is no transparency about who has been signing all these petitions, why they did it, what impact it has had on them etc; 4) it made no sense constitutionally (or was inappropriately Presidential) for people to be encouraged to petition the Prime Minister.

Defenders pointed out: 1) properly moderating thousands of discussions was not an option 2) some petitions (e.g. the one against road pricing) caused a media storm and did have some impact, while others at least highlighted to politicians and civil servants that there was a public voice to be listened to 3) No 10 plan to commission an academic review of how the site has worked (its only been going one year) 4) this site was a good opportunity for No 10 to set a precedent and it has certainly woke up Whitehall and Parliament to the scope and need to use Web 2.0 tools.

Overall, my thoughts are congratulations to Jimmy Leach and Tom Steinberg for actually getting the site up and having an impact. Web 2.0 is about disruption and if you can disrupt from No 10 Downing Street, then good for you.  As I said last week, I don't think e-petitions are by any means the most important aspect of e-democracy, but at least they highlight the scope for getting citizens involved.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Paul's comments are important because they highlight the often unrealistic expectations with which these kinds of ventures are greeted.  So because ePetitions fail to pretty much change the nature of the democratic conversation all on their own and overnight they are dismissed as peripheral or unimportant.  We're much better, and wiser, to see these initiatives as cumulative and incremental, each one chipping away at the hard rock of entrenched practice and political culture.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="RotisSemiSansLight"><a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/hamel/2007/11/moving_management_online_part.html?cm_mmc=npv-_-listserv-_-NOV_2007-_-GlobalBus">A recent piece</a> from famed management writer and all-round guru Gary Hamel is worth a quick look. Just in case you thought the whole "everything 2.0" debate was in need of a little more hyperbole, this is Hamel’s basic message:</font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="RotisSemiSansLight">"Over the next decade or two, it is likely that Internet will grow into the most powerful tool that humanity has ever possessed for boosting human accomplishment…Eventually, the Web may allow each of us to avoid the trade-off between fully exercising our humanity and being a full partner in a grand enterprise, between being enormously creative and enormously productive, between doing the things we love and doing things at scale. Even in its adolescence, the Web gives us reason to believe that such hopes are not entirely naïve."</font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="RotisSemiSansLight">Call me a gullible old romantic, but isn’t Hamel right basically? Give or take the pesky issues of people, culture, the availbility of talent etc etc, the Internet does seem to hold out the prospect of being able to do both of management’s core tasks at the same time – to amplify and to aggregate human talent.</font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="RotisSemiSansLight">There's an interesting link developing between the vision of a 'connected republic' as the model for governing into the 21st centiury, the model of connected government that suggests how the public sector itself might operate and then these ideas of a new management approach, telling us something about the way people and leaders in the public sector might find themselves actually working.</font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="RotisSemiSansLight">Here's one of Hamel's tyically pithy and slightly uncomfortable shots across the bow of lumbering old hierarchies unable to see the damage their management 1.0 instincts are inflicting on the social networks from which all the innovation they crave actually springs:</font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="RotisSemiSansLight">"Yet as every victim of red tape, myopic leadership, and organizational inertia knows, bureaucracies aren’t very good at amplifying human capabilities. In a Management 1.0 regime, initiative and creativity nearly always take a back seat to conformance and alignment. In such a setting, individuals with a sense of derring-do are labeled loose cannons; those with a large dollop of creative genius are dismissed as romantic dreamers; and anyone who’s truly passionate is likely to be viewed as slightly delusional. It’s hardly surprising, then, that most large organizations are less lively, less creative, and less adaptable—in short, less human—than the people who work there."</font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="RotisSemiSansLight">Have a read and tell us what you think. Check out Hamel's site too...he's always worth a read</font></font></font>.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Of course I believe in people and culture - I was trying to be a bit tongue-in-cheek I guess.  The risk with Hamel's prescription is that he seems to discount the people, culture and other real-life issues that matter very much and is in danger of giving the impression that the Internet can somehow transcend these challanges.  So long as we keep it all in perspective, I think his basic point about the transformative potential of the Internet, remains true</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">I have just returned from a 5-day trip to Amber, near Jaipur in Rajasthan, India. I flew to Delhi then took a four-hour car drive to Amber - this was my first taste of India.  I have already travelled to Africa, Pakistan and the Middle East and my snapshot of India leaves me puzzled, the people, especially the women, as so colourful but this is contrasted by, for example, mountains of litter, people urinating and abject poverty. You quickly get used to camels pulling carts, elephants carrying loads, dogs, sheep, goats and cows wandering everywhere. On most flat areas of land you will see an impromptu cricket match.  I wasn’t expecting the freely wandering pigs however. But the litter and dirtiness is strange to accept, most walls are stained with urine and tiny children intermingle with traffic begging at most corners, even the busiest intersections.<a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/women.jpg" title="women.jpg"><img src="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/women.jpg" alt="women.jpg" /></a>
Yet the colours of the women’s clothes are wonderful and vibrant. The roads are fantastic but the driving totally dangerous, I saw a car reverse down the outside lane of a 4 lane motorway, a car drive the wrong way around a roundabout and a lorry on it’s side, the load of paving slabs strewn across the road. This could of course be due poor driving or to one of the ubiquitous cows wandering anywhere and everywhere.<a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/schoolboy.jpg" title="schoolboy.jpg"><img src="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/schoolboy.jpg" alt="schoolboy.jpg" /></a>
In Delhi, Jaipur and Amber, the magnificence of the Mogul buildings and British new Delhi are in stark contrast to the general squalor.  A man bent double, walking on all fours on wooden blocks near a market was not an uncommon sight. And India is a nuclear power?
The schools were bare and spartan. The walls had posters depicting how to be nice and how to develop good habits. The learners were dressed in the state uniform and many wrote on slates a few had exercise books. There were very few text books and lessons were all teacher at the front, class at desks copying.  One school had only recently been donated desks and chairs. Some classes sat on the floor, always in neat, quiet rows.  Class sizes varied. In one school a class of just 7 older children studied science. This was from a text book but there was no apparatus in sight, this is taught as a theoretical exercise. In another school of 180 the head teacher was there to greet us, apparently he rarely attended school, only 15 days in the last month, turning up at 10 and leaving before 2 each day. The only other teacher in the school, yep, just one other teacher was responsible for all 180 learners!  A complaint had been raised by the community, but mot much action had been taken so far. This school did have a women’s project attached to it and the women were making cloth, clothes, greetings cards and so on, all to an amazing standard.
In the communities surrounding the schools there were many people sitting around doing nothing.  Children clearly not in school are everywhere and some young looking children were putting sequins into saris, they looked school age to me.   I could not get a straight answer to an estimate of how many learners were not in school, but it must be significant and given the chaos I would have doubts about how anyone would have accurate figures.  I would guess that 40% children are not in school.<a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/schoolgirls.jpg" title="schoolgirls.jpg"><img src="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/schoolgirls.jpg" alt="schoolgirls.jpg" /></a>
In class the learners were quiet and respectful but clearly as bright as buttons, one little boy had turned up a few weeks ago and asked if he join a class, so he was in. The simple fact is the kids want to learn and most if the teachers want to teach.  However, the schools are drab places with no celebration if learning or much in the way of learning stimulation. Rajsthan is part of the WEF global education initiative but nobody had heard of it on the ground, but a Government official told me how well it was working.  Unicef and British Airways support a project  that is stimulating environmental awareness and teacher training but it is all very basic stuff.
Nobody seems to be tackling adult illiteracy, which is very high and was told that most adult women are unable to read, but often they pick up what work there is to support a family.  Often the woman is the main breadwinner.  $2 a day represents a good family income in the area, but very clearly, many do not reach this level of income.
The educators need help, they need structure and they need resources, the communities need access to opportunities because in between the inactivity there are communities trying to make a difference, small enterprises, like the sari makers making beautifully coloured garments  are in fact around most corners, but  for every person working there were at least as many not.
I spoke with the teachers about what they wanted to do with the televisions and DVD players that had been recently donated to three of the schools. Truthfully, they didn’t  know. The thought that some stories or cartoons might be good for the younger learners.  I suggested that they may start looking at the areas of the curriculum like environmental studies that might be supported with videos, as this could not just impact learning , but also impact their own environment.  But they have not got a curriculum development frame of mind – there is a long way to go before they will start to comprehend the possibilities available through technologies.
The DVD players have the potential, if training is provided, to start to open up creative possibilities for the schools but since they have no money to purchase more DVD tiltes the chance of this having an impact will depend upon the ability of the community to explore how new technologies (to them) can start to impact learning.
As I said earlier, I’m puzzled, levels of education elsewhere are very high but people with degrees still aspire to be telesales works and I have seen first hand very poor standards of education. The communities themselves are the key, education is just one part of life and I am convinced that a coordinated community effort is necessary to make a long lasting change to the lives of the people in the community. All that is needed is opportunity and some well thought through support. The people are bright and willing we have a responsibility to help them to be able to help themselves.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Its gr8 2 read a feedback post about my country, but i feel the title needs to be revamped as its not ur "reflection in India" rather Its a miniature part of India, coz India is the most diversified country as far as "a tourist experience" is concerned.

 so u need 2 explore our country again for having that title.;-)
...ur welcome anytime..

<wp:comment_content>Enjoyed reading your comments and brought back some good memories of my days as a student in the city of Chandigarh in norther India.

India is like a drug: When you are on it you want to get off and when you are off it you want to get back on it!

Women empowerment is the way forward for many projects and education and in India (and the rest of the world)</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning I received my letter from the acting chairman of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs apologizing for having lost data about my family. The letter went pretty much straight into the (recycling) bin, but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7104945.stm">the whole sorry saga</a> has done a fantastic job of highlighting the issue of data handling to most of the UK population. Having worked in a variety of public sector organisations, I am not in the least surprised that something like this can have happened and clearly there are many avenues to explore to try to minimise the risk of further such occurrences. However, I don't want to focus on this incident as a new stick to beat the UK government with or the public sector in general. The main implication I would highlight is how under-developed most people's thinking (including my own!) is in this area. Just we are only beginning to wake up to the opportunities of a connected world, so too are  we only slowly beginning to recognise (and think through) some of the perils.   The HMRC employee who put data relating to 25 million UK citizens in an unregistered envelope is demonstrating a similar data-protection-blindness that I exemplify when I throw away my old bank statements - only his foolishness potentially affects a rather larger number of people than mine! In any event this is an area that is clearly going to be increasingly important for government. On the one hand, it needs to take action to educate citizens (and organisations) to help us all become more digitally literate in this area. On the other hand, it needs to develop (to say the least) its own practices and standards in this area. To foster and contribute to this debate some colleagues of mine are working on a whitepaper called Safe to Play which aims to explore the trust issues for government and citizens in a connected world. The current draft of the paper is available on the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/downloads/">downloads page</a> of this site and Martin has started <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=68">a discussion in the forums</a> on this. So do please read the draft whitepaper and contribute to the discussion to help improve the material. In the meantime I am off to close all my bank accounts, think up new amazingly obscure passwords and change my name by deed poll to Frank Goodman (opps I think I had better go for some other name now).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last week has been a bit education-dominated for me. Some of my corporate colleagues are working on a vision presentation about 21st Century Education, which makes a dyed-in the world twentieth century person like myself feel a bit old, while a bit closer to home IBSG have just brought out an excellent whitepaper (<a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/downloads/">which is on the downloads page</a>) that explores how education can be transformed in a systematic and sustainable way.

I also very much enjoyed Sir Ken Robinson's <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le21/le34/nobel/2007/speaker_bio.html#shah" target="_blank">Ted talk on education,</a> which is a plea for an education system that nutures creativity rather than crushes it.  Actually  I think this is one of those arguments one needs to be careful about making because it looks good but risks being meaningless. No one is going to argue against creativity, but it is also not very clear exactly what Sir Ken wants the education system to do in order to encourage creativity better. His most obvious suggestions are put lots more art, music and dance on the curriculum, and since these are all areas that I am weak in, this may be one reason why I found him more entertaining than inspiring!

For me, however, the real takeaway was his suggestion that our education system is distorted by the fact that it has long been seen as a conveyor belt for universities - so the best education is the one that produces the best university students. I had never looked at it in these terms before. But I do not see the main implication of this as being about encouraging more creativity (and/or art, music and dance); rather it emphasis the need to develop the individual as a person and give them the broad range of skills that will help them have a good (and if you like, economically productive) life. Perhaps rather than pushing higher and higher percentages of our young people to university, we should disrupt the system by not allowing anyone to attend university until they are 25 or older. That would certainly focus our minds on making sure that schools prepare our eighteen-year-olds for life rather than university. And if it meant that lots of people were encouraged to go back to education a bit later in life, that too might be rather good. Anyway, not very likely to happen, but its my take on Sir Ken's plea to rescue our education system from the grip of university academics!]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>i think Sir Ken's rather more substantive point, rather than should we have more dance on the curiculum, is that we have reached a stage where we need to revisit exactly what it is we think the education system, and the process it enables, is meant to be achieving.  if it's not feeding the factories of the industrial era or the intellectual requirements of the university sector, what is the point?  And how do we make sure that the way we design and manage education, the way we teach, the way we expect people to learn, the physical spaces in which they do it and, crucially, the manner in which we decide to assess their competence are not only aligned one to the other but bear some resemblance to the purpose we had in mind in the first place.  I agree with Paul that inspiring and witty speakers like Ken Robinson are sometime dangerous and distracting, especially when (as in his dance example in the TED presentation)he relies on wonderful, but obviously outlier examples.  But his very important insight is of an education system and process that has basically come adrift from its moorings.  That means we need to re-connect it to something that makes sense for the kinds of skills and capabilities that people need in this world and what is emerging, not what they needed i nthe 19th century.  Sir Ken is on the right track, it seems to me.  The territory he's opening up is fraught with complexity and contest, but it is the territory, nonetheless, in which education policy and learning frameworks for the future will be forged.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Today’s news that a couple of schools have been found to have changed student answers in statutory tests is an indicator of the pressures being brought onto the education system through continuous and incessant attention to standards, efficiency and effectiveness.  League tables, which do not officially exist in the UK, are constructed from Government data by newspapers and a small number of measures are used to compare the effectiveness of a schools with one another, when published they cover miles of column inches.
I am totally confident that the teachers that allegedly changed the students’ scores would never have done so when assessing day to day work, used for formative decision making, they did this because of the crude public way in which their personal effectiveness has come to be measured.
For some reason the debate around education implies a never ending criticism of the service and a need for perpetual reform as for some other set of reasons the service does not, according to most commentators, appear to be fit for purpose, ever.  The comments from TED demonstrate one thing to me, that we do not know what the purpose of education is. I know one thing for sure, that there is not one single purpose, no one size fits all within a country and between countries.  Look at Hansard (The UK record of parliament) and you will see ferocious complaints from over a hundred years ago that education at the time was not delivering a well trained and skilled workforce. Some things never change.
I see amazing educators everywhere I go and educators doing an a world class job in terrible circumstances.  It isn’t their fault if they have had no training and have no resources or even a building.  They need opportunity much more than reform!  In Romania I was in a first floor classroom with a hole in the floor, in Nairobi, where rats had eaten through the telephone cables, in Bristol where the examination room was wrecked by vandals, 5 times in a few weeks.
So who’s right? Well of course, I am. But let’s try to help the poor teachers that feel the need to abuse a system so that they aren’t seen to fail in public. The last public hanging  was on May 26th, 1868, or so I thought.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As an ex-civil servant, I always get annoyed when I hear people bashing the public sector especially if they seem to be arguing from a private sector - good, public sector - bad perspective. Of course, my current employer is perfect in every way (!), but you would have to have lived a very strange or fortunate life not to have come across many private sector examples of  incompetence, nonsensical bureaucracy, empire-building etc. So it is odd how many people love to do a bit of public sector bashing. Actually, I had a funny example yesterday when a senior, now-public sector figure with experience of both sectors started to explain to me how slow the public sector is to change. Personally I suspect that all large organisations are "slow to change" if that means "adopt the path the leaders of the organisation have decided to move forward on". In fact, this applies even to small organisations or dare I say it individuals. Certainly when I make a decision to try to change my own behaviour, I do sometimes experience difficulty in "driving through change"!

Anyway, this is all a bit of a diversion. What I really wanted to highlight was <a href="http://richarddennison.wordpress.com/2007/12/03/five-reasons-not-to-let-social-media-tools-onto-your-intranet/" target="_blank">some interesting comments</a> I came across about introducing social networking tools in a corporate environment. The advice here struck me as very sensible and what I liked is that it shows how it is just as much a struggle for private sector companies to embrace these new tools and approachs as public sector organisations. And of course the added reason for caution that the public sector has is that whatever they do risks becoming political or media cannon-fodder. You know the sort of thing I mean - "Civil Servants in Recipe-Swapping Scandal" or "Paid to chat - how Whitehall is wasting millions on social networking". I suppose public sector workers just have to recognise that this sort of risk comes with the territory.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We had a great session on "government 2.0" at the just-completed Nobel Public Services Summit in Stockholm this week.</p>

Speakers included Geoff Mulgan (The Young Foundation, founder of DEMOS in the UK and Tony Blair policy advisor), Joanne Caddy (senior policy analyst at the OECD with a focus on citizen engagement), Hugh McPhail (leader of the eGovernment team in New Zealand’s State Services Commision) and Tom Bentley (senior advisor in the Dept of Premier &amp; Cabinet in Victoria, Australia and former advisor to current UK PM Gordon Brown).  We also had great input from two senior officials from the IT Directorate of the European Commission, Henrik Hololei (Chef de Cabinet for Commissioner Sim Kallas, Commissioner for Administration) and Francisco Garcia Moran, Director-General of the IT Directorate itself).The backdrop for the session was the astonishing rise of social networking and the collaborative Web, which is generating some lively debate about the impact of the new tools of so-called Web 2.0 on the business of government.  Politicians making announcements on YouTube and setting up their own pages on MySpace or Facebook, government agencies discovering the joys of wikis and even, with some trepidation, blogs and online forums – there is no shortage of evidence of interesting experiments with these new capabilities.
<p>But we started with the view that it remains an open question as to whether and, if so, exactly how this more collaborative phase of the Internet is going to change the structures and processes of government and the way politicians, bureaucrats and citizens behave and interact.  </p>
<p>More to come on key issues, insights and implications...</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Times New Roman">We had a great discussion on the prospects and possibilities facing government from the growing impact of Web 2.0 tools and capabilities. These are just a few of the insights from the 3-hour discussion:</font>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">In the end, the discussion about Web 2.0 and its impact on government was a discussion about redistributing power and authority and strengthening democracy.  Radical change and deep structural reform would be slow and in some cases impossible.   But anything that improved, even if incrementally, the way citizens could engage with and influence the public policy and management process was a good thing. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">The new more collaborative web offered a bunch of tools for engagement and interaction that were mostly good and useful.  They tended to be less useful in the face of conflicting interests and making some of the hard trade-offs that are often at the heart of politics. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">There were mounting pressures for change in the way politics, policy and public services were conducted from rising generations of digital natives for whom the instincts and tools of Web 2.0 were not revolutionary, but simply the way they lived. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">We are witnessing a contest between the potential for disruptive change offered by the new tools and capabilities of the collaborative web and the potential for denial and delay from within the system.  We shouldn’t underestimate the risks of these new tools being either blunted or co-opted by existing interests and those with entrenched positions of power and control.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">The best way to explore the potential of the new tools of Web 2.0 was to start inside, that is, to start using them in the day-to-day work of government agencies and politicians.  If you don’t get a sense of what these tools can do and the value they bring in your own work, it’s hard to imagine how you can champion them as tools of reform for the wider processes of public policy, service delivery and citizen engagement.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">There’s a real question of just how long governments and their systems of public management have got to respond to the pressure for reform that these tools, and the expectations of those for whom they have become second nature, really bring.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">By contrast, there was some agreement that at some point there existed an irreconcilable conflict between the instincts and ethics of Web 2.0 – open, collaborative and trusting – and the need  in some situations in government for secrecy and the need (or desire?) to wield raw power and authority to achieve policy outcomes.  </font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Times New Roman">Not sure what you think...irreconcilable conflict between Web 2 and the traditional structures and habits of government, or are we witnessing a kind of 'slow burn' as these new technologies quietly, but inevitably, erode those stuctures and habits?  </font>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night I was at the UK's <a href="http://www.rsa.org.uk/">Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts</a> and took part in a fascinating discussion on empowerment, hosted by the RSA's chief executive Matthew Taylor and featuring an interesting contribution from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andy Burnham. What was particularly striking was the way each participant seemed to come at the debate from a different perspective. For some empowerment was about moving away from a consumerist approach to public services (with an emphasis on choice and improved delivery) to a perspective that encourages citizens to take more responsibility for their lives and to take ownership of “their” public services. For others, it was about moving away from central government command and control and empowering more local parts of the state and public servants within them. Not so much citizen empowerment as frontline public servant empowerment.
One example that dominated the discussion were moves in the UK to give social care recipients direct control of the money being used to support them. That way recipients can determine the most appropriate blend and type of services to improve their situation. This was generally seen as a welcome move away from producer-led services and towards letting citizens build services that were genuinely citizen-centric. But while few wanted to oppose this step in social care (or at least for some fairly specific categories of social care recipient), there was quite a lot of discomfort about how far this sort of change could be generalized. Surely in some areas citizens did just want effective delivery rather than empowerment? And while some services could be co-produced with citizens (e.g. nursery or primary education?), more complex services (such as secondary education) might prove tougher for citizens to do for themselves.
Although not explicitly mentioned, there were clearly some submerged political issues running beneath the debate in this area, since many of the participants in the debate came from what would traditionally be seen as a left-of-centre position and yet replacing public provision by giving the money to citizens and letting them choose their provider is traditionally a right-wing perspective. Disrupting producer power and abandoning one size fits all solutions sound great, but will that generate a multi-tiered service with those at the bottom of society getting a markedly inferior service in multiple areas of their lives?  Can the state just to do some kind of financial redistribution and then stand out of the way and let whatever happens happen?
Surprisingly, a lot of the talk did seem to be about financial empowerment, whereas I had been expecting the debate to focus more on the new scope for getting citizens much more involved in public sector decision-making. Tom Steinberg made the excellent point that there was a lot of mileage in just putting public service users in touch with each other. So if I have feedback on my local hospital, I do not just give the feedback to the hospital but am connected with others who have given feedback and all those taking an interest in how that hospital is run. I agree with Tom that this sort of simple move could be a powerful lever for change (especially if it is combined with transparency, so I can see all the other feedback the public sector organization has received). The other point this leads onto (which we did not really discuss) is individual empowerment vs community empowerment. How does empowerment work when it is going to generate a mass of conflicting choices and demands?
So an amazingly complex agenda, but one that is deeply relevant in the UK where we have seen a government embrace command and control on a massive scale in the hope of delivering truly excellent public services (and long-living, happy citizens). Now there seems to be a recognition that things need to change, but we only seem to be at the beginning of the debate as to who should be empowered and how.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Great post and some really good issues raised here.  It prompted some questions:

Why are empowerment and good quality public services seen as mutually exclusive choices?

Why do we assume that people on the lower end of the socio-economic scale won’t be able to negotiate, either themselves or with whatever support and advice they need, a service mix and outcome at least equal to, and perhaps superior to, anyone else?

Why do we start from the assumption that command-and-control, centralised public provision of public services actually provide equity and consistent quality ? Clearly they often do not, which is wny we labour so mightily to 'reform' public services in virtually every jurisdiction I know. This is despite the best intentions (and the ideological predisposition) of those who are responsible for designing and delivering them?

Why are ‘uneven’ public services necessarily wrong?  Why does the notion of everyone getting exactly the same make sense anyway?

The notion that empowerment has to result in people actually running their own services is simplistic and misleading.  It’s also a false dichtomomy perhaps set up by those seeking to preserve the status quo and anxious to avoid any change by suggesting that the only change available is to this relatively extreme position.  Mind you, there are some great examples of people who do actually want to do it for themselves - setting up schools, impriving services for disabled people.  I know of several here in Australia. But in many cases, the real empowerment that people want is not to run social welfatre or education servides (although in the education space, there’s plenty of evidence and a great deal of successful practice to suggest that is exactly what people want to do, and often can do much better than standaridsed, centralised public provision), but rather to inject some sense of power and control over the design, delivery and quality of the services they need.  Noone suggests that consumer empowerment in the airline industry means everyone wants to run their own airline.  For most people, except perhaps Richard Branson, what they want is a level of choice, influence and status as a customer to have a real impact on the quality, timeleness, safety etc of the services they want. I’m an empowered air traveler not because I run Qantas but because I have enough clout as a consumer to have an impact on the services they offer and, in the end, can chose to fly with someone else whose service bundle might better suit me and my needs.  

There's a great piece of work I can post to the site from Australia looking at whole new approaches to disability services.  The model is essentially an empowered consumer model.  As the author, Vern Hughes, points out though, it's introduction would challenge central assumptions about powe, control and authority and, importantly, shift the focus away from those who supply services to those who demand them.  Vern's model is all about giving those people the money and the authoirty to act as real consumers.  Scary stuff and, of course, stoutly resisted by those whose interests are protected by the status quo.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Times New Roman">The whole session was titled ‘Government 2.0 – fad or future?’  So what did we conclude by the end of the discussion?  I think we decided that government 2.0 was more future than fad, that a long-term, gradual and unstoppable revolution had started that would dramatically change the processes, structures and behaviour of governments and that by and large that was a very good thing.  At the same time, we weren’t blind to the obvious obstacles that would provide plenty of opportunity for resistance and delay.  Nor were people naïve enough to think that the entrenched cultures and structures of governing would be easy to shift.  But what I took away from the discussion overall was a real sense of possibility and opportunity.  With a mixture of excitement, realism and some trepidation, I felt that people were for the most part prepared to sign up for the ‘government 2.0’ revolution, largely in the end because the accumulating demographic and performance improvement imperatives impacting governments and their public management systems would prove, in the end, to be irresistible.   </font><font face="Times New Roman">I think people decide these questions in the end depending on whether they tend to be realists or romantics.  In the end, I am a bit of both.  The romantic in me sees the disruptive possibilities of these new technologies and the way they might refresh the vision and values of public management.  The realist in me sees deep, structural resistance and massive opportunities for denial and delay from many who currently occupy the commanding heights of power and control and therefore whose personal and professional interests are most challenged by the potential for change.  I think in the end they will lose, but it won’t be without a fight.  </font><font face="Times New Roman">Here are a few final points that were summarised by Hillingdon CIO Steve Palmer who was an active and very thoughtful participant in the Nobel discussions…</font>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">The Web 2.0 developments challenge leadership and the legitimacy of political roles, responsibilities and structures in uncomfortable ways. It also gives an opportunity for "true" democracy - a possibly scary possibility to those who hold or enjoy power under the old rules.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">There is a need to be open, honest and transparent in what issues we are properly prepared to engage communities/people in making decisions upon. Where do we want genuine engagement (web 2.0) may work in shaping? Where to want real or pretend consultation (web 2.0 may work). For the "no go" areas it won't work but what are the consequences of governments deciding not to engage - web 2.0 can be used to create very collaborative opposition.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">The technologies are benign, the content provides the stimulus. What are the consequences of failure to mesh what can be perceived as revolutionary technologies with the business of government?</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">There is a huge opportunity however to generate well informed, genuine innovation and engagement at community level including providing some added opportunities to develop true social innovation.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">We need to accept there is disconnect between the methods of collaboration, communication and aspiration of emerging generations against antiquated workplaces, workstyle and work based technologies.</font></li>

<title>Empowering the Poor</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Empowerment was a key theme during our December 10, 2007 “Socially Inclusive Growth” specialist session at Cisco's Public Services Summit. The topic was economic development and social inclusion of the poor, highlighting three project that are both scalable and sustainable. Below I share some of our dialogue around empowerment, a few compelling on-the-ground impacts and chime in on what Paul raised re: who should be empowered and how; citizen, community, and financial empowerment.

“Empowerment” seems a basic term — generally, governments, NGOs, private sector support “empowering the poor,” yet it can be elusive to actually achieve.

In the context of emerging regions, one description of citizen empowerment is “having access to information to make informed decisions about improving one’s own life and opportunities to do so.” One notion we put forth is that the problem is “the people are poor, not stupid.”

While few would disagree, the challenge is whether programs are designed to tap into the capabilities of the people to improve their own lives. Frequently, organizations (whether gov’t, civil society or private sector) try perhaps to do more than they should, thereby disempowering targeted beneficiaries.

Case in point, we reviewed in some detail a national poverty alleviation program that’s being implemented in Sri Lanka. The Gemidiriya (meaning Village Empowerment) model was developed by the World Bank and poor communities, starting in 2000 with a 3-village pilot. The formal scale-up started in 2004.

Empowerment is an essential success factor to this community driven development (CDD) program, which will reach 1,000 rural villages (1M Sri Lankans) by end of 2007 and has a target of 5,000-8,000 add’l villages in the next few years. These villages have ~1,000 people and are among the poorest of the poor.

The Gemidiriya success is rooted building strong village governance. The approach helps villagers create a “Village Organization” enabling the community to come together to discuss issues, prioritize their work, and allocate funds (Yes – they must contribute to projects. In a recent call we reiterated that in successful dev. projects the poor contribute – whether cash, labor or combination). There are formal boards and committees, and women hold 50% of decision-making positions, and youth (ages 16-35), 30%. These Village Organizations tap into the full talent base, and with access to combination of grant and loan funding, the communities have solved for the most urgent infrastructure needs – water, sanitation, roads, small bridges.

For Gemidiriya, the elements of individual and community empowerment are not “either/or,” but rather “and.”

In particular, to look into the eyes of women – elder and youth – it is palpable how much the opportunity for individual empowerment and voice within the community is valued. While I was in the field observing groups discuss needs, they clearly understood the need to solve community interests, while also care for those least able to do so. The Gemidiriya communities are bound by a set of “10 Golden Rules” (Unity, Self-Esteem, Accountability, Trust, Realism, Thrift, Transparency, Equality, Consensus, Sincerity). These shared values are 200% internalized in every interaction and decision. Empowerment brings with it responsibility and Gemidiriya poor communities understand and exemplify this, perhaps in some cases better than developed areas.

The communities decide on and manage execution of the projects (e.g., vendor selection, type of system, follow-on support). As communities “graduate,” they form a “Village Company” focused on improving livelihoods. These Companies have formed partnerships with private sector, attracting investment from leading national and multinational business agencies, including a commitment of $10 million from National Dairy Development Board, India.

In a given village, “community professionals” emerge as those who are leading the change for their community. These CPs (think of them as internal consultants who may specialize in water, sanitation, facilitation, etc.) then are paid by other villages to assist their implementation. A chief reason for the successful scaling lies in Sri Lankans helping Sri Lankans (not relying on bringing in more and more external World Bank staff or others).

Key areas of impact with government include:
• The Government of Sri Lanka has been the entity to decide “who was poor” and “who were the poorest of the poor” and what benefits to provide. This did not result in well targeted, effective programs. In Gemidiriya, the communities determine who are most needy, and great care is focused on serving the most vulnerable. This is influencing the government’s policy for targeting.
• In succeeding with infrastructure projects, communities have built up confidence of their capabilities and their collective voice to interact with local gov’t. They’ve begun to speak with local officials and are tapping into streams of available gov’t funding, thereby decreasing reliance on World Bank funds. Local officials see Gemidiriya as a way to previously unreached, unheard from constituents.
• This holistic, empowerment model has been chosen for the government’s national poverty reduction program (a similar approach was in progress and they’ve decided to converge on the Gemidiriya metholodogy.

Stay tuned, we’re now endeavoring to apply the success of CDD to help villagers benefit from ICT – creating bottom-up momentum for ICT to improve livelihoods.

Perhaps it can be easier to “start empowerment from scratch” vs. dissect the conflicting choices and demands of a UK. Though places like the UK may indeed learn from the Gemidiriya example of functioning communities, which abide by the 10 Golden Rules and can raise tough issues, discuss, prioritize needs and solve for their most pressing needs.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Great story - a good reminder of the famous observation that the only thing that's different between the rich and the poor is that the rich have got more money! 

Which suggests that the key to success is to find ways to get more money and assets into the hands of poor communities so they can start the normal wealth creation cycle that everyone else relies on.

The governance piece is obviously important too, as Molly's story suggests.  But in the end, communities can't pull out of the poverty cycle unless they get traction with the real economy and find a way of engaging with the process of trade and production that fuels the virtuous cycle of wealth, asset creation and productivity.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Australian academic Axel Bruns has just launched a <a href="http://produsage.org/" target="_blank">website</a> (soon to be followed by a book) where he celebrates the new era of “produsage” – the idea being that in certain collaborative communities “the creation of shared content takes place in a networked, participatory environment which breaks down the boundaries between producers and consumers and instead enables all participants to be users as well as producers of information and knowledge - frequently in a hybrid role of produser where usage is necessarily also productive.”. There are a lot of interesting ideas on the site, although personally I doubt whether the phrase “produsage” is going to be a smash hit. I also rather fear that production and consumerism are both likely to continue to dominate most people’s lives (indeed, are likely to dominate the lives of increasing numbers of people as China, India, etc continue to grow rapidly).

Axel talks about the principles and preconditions of produsage, but I am not sure I agree with all of his analysis and it is quite complicated (and for me sometimes a bit confusing). Here’s my take on what he is talking about. We are definitely seeing the emergence of a new form of value creation. The precondition of which are network technologies that enable large-scale many-to-many communication. In contrast to traditional value creation based on the interaction of hierarchical organisations, in this emerging model value is created by self-organising virtual communities. Participation is as open as possible and the status of participants is determined on a dynamic, real-time basis by their contribution (as assessed by the community) rather than by who they are (their organisational role/job title etc). The value creation process moves forward probabilistically rather than on a linear or planned basis – quality comes from the number and diversity of the people engaged on the task rather than top-down enforcement of a pre-given plan or strategy. Everyone’s contribution is fully and permanently open to view, so all members of the community have the same ability to assess how the project is progressing. The value created is available to all (including non active participants) but active participants do get individual rewards either in terms of the satisfaction or status gained from participating in the value-generating community  or because there are spin-off benefits from participation. Generally, this approach works best where tasks are granular, i.e. can easily be split up into small elements that can be worked up separately. (Conversely, this approach is not the best way to write a novel – although I know (unsuccessful) attempts to do just this have been made!). For me the really interesting issue is mapping out where this new approach will work best and why. I certainly think it has got limits, but I also think that since it is new, there must be zillions of areas where applying it could be really useful.

So those are Axel’s points that hit home with me. Apologies to him if I have distorted them and for the many points I have missed out! In fact,  I would be very interested to know what he and others think I have left out or distorted. So do feel free to look at <a href="http://produsage.org/" target="_blank">the site</a> and then add a comment with your own reactions.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Hi Paul,

thanks for the write-up, and the invitation to comment on it. I think the key aspect I'd add here is that we need to draw an important distinction between informational and industrial production/produsage in this discussion: produsage, at least at present, operates almost exclusively in the informational realm, where the preconditions (probabilistic approaches, equipotential involvement, granularity of tasks, and shared content) are most likely to be met. So, it would be entirely possible to continue to engage with physical, material goods in a conventional consumeristic fashion, while dealing with informational commodities through produsage.

So, I wouldn't want to make the claim that produsage is going to replace conventional production/consumption right across the board any time soon (even if it is beginning to make some inroads even into the physical realm) - I do think we're moving (in some cases quite rapidly) towards a replacement of production/consumption with produsage in the informational realm, though. 

In fact, I'd argue that production and consumption were never terms which applied particularly well to information and knowledge - neither is the process of knowledge-making ever complete (so that it's misleading to speak of 'production' in its core sense), nor do we 'consume' (that is, use up) information in the way that we consume food, natural resources, or even physical goods.

In spite of this, for the last half-century or more we have applied (physical) production concepts to our understanding of and engagement with information, with increasingly unsatisfactory results. Today, we're seeing that alternative approaches are possible - and produsage as a concept is designed to think through these alternatives.

Anyway, thanks for the plug on your site - looking forward to any further comments. In addition to the definition and brief introduction to produsage on my site, your might also be interested in some of the preliminary papers on produsage I've published and presented, which are also available on the site, at http://produsage.org/articles and http://produsage.org/presentations.

<wp:comment_content>The idea of collaboration using computers is a fine thing, and should always be encouraged. However, the real problem lies with knowledge overload. It would be nice to see a collaboration in which descriptions, and  notably in this case arguments/debates pro, and con against any issue (eg.social, economic, and political ones) could be developed. This would be presented, and edited in a listed "note-form" rather than large chunks of  writings.

Moreover,   the data presented is reduced to the least number of words without loosing out on all known "minor" arguments.  In other words, like Wikipedia it would be an "up-to-date" clearance house, and open source  of virtually "all" data on any subject with input from any number of people (both experts, and laymen). 

Thus, a more objective understanding would come about without having to first know "everything" about any particular topic, and this could ofcourse involves many years of research, and study. Furthermore, because of the editing it would be possible to become an "instant" expert on anything.

The ultimate aim of this is to lead to the creation of new ideas which may have social, economic, and political implications. The problem with todays world is that there is too much information, and we need to reduce it to its basics so that we have a far quicker, and better way of dealing with it in a positive progressive fashion.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I finally managed to read an excellent document that my good colleague and friend Martin alerted me to - <a href="http://www.ipa.org.au/publications/publisting_detail.asp?pubid=505" target="_blank">Vern Hughes's paper on the Empowerment Agenda</a>. The paper advocates moving from the current supply-side service delivery model (where citizens are seen as passive recipients) to a model that puts power in the hands of citizens and users.  This sounds great, and, although there will obviously be lots of opposition (particularly from established suppliers!), it is definitely the direction we should be heading in. However, it is interesting to explore some of the issues that it raises.

Vern's paper focuses on disability and mental health and argues that the users of these services should have pretty much full control of the money spent on helping them - either directly or through consumer brokers. So they (or their agents) should choose what services they want or need and who they obtain them from. One difficult issue this pushes to the fore is quantifying need - every service user would have to have a cash entitlement figure assigned to them. In a way of course this is just making transparent what currently happens (because in principle you could work out the value of service received by each service user or the average for particular types etc). But setting this all out in black and white, so that one kind of disability entitles you to a particular cash figure of support that is 23% more that of another type of disability, will to say the least raise a certain amount of rather lively debate. The difficult choices and comparisons are easier to hide if provision takes the form of appropriate support being provided (with of course scope in particular cases for the support not being quite as appropriate as ideally one might like).

My reference to "appropriate" support raises another issue, which is the fear that user groups will use money inappropriately. To use the sort of example that opponents would no doubt leap on, what if someone decides to blow their annual allocation of support on a Carribean holiday, arguing that this is what would make the best contribution to their quality of life or best help improve their condition? What if parent-carers makes this decision on the behalf of the person they are caring for and of course have to accompany this person? This is an extreme example, but it is likely to encourage some to argue for allowing user-held budgets but then adding a vast body of rules that specify exactly what kinds of things budget-holders can spend money on. And yet this kind of top-down, bureaucratic regulation is clearly what Vern wants to get away from. So do we have to go the whole hog and give total freedom to budget holders or are there sensible ways of putting some kind of framework in place that allows freedom without permitting exercises of that freedom that would offend the broad mass of citizens who as taxpayers ultimately fund the provision?

This would suggest that the emphasis on accountability to service users needs somehow to be balanced by accountability to the taxpayer. Maybe in current systems both types of accountability are poor, but undoubtedly part of the attraction of supply-side delivery models is that the government (on the taxpayer's behalf) has lots of control of what support gets given. So the change would be moving from a model of "society/the state give support to certain groups but society/the state decide exactly what that support is" to a model of "we collectively assign a cash entitlement figure to every category of person who needs support and anyone who can demonstrate that they belong to that category is free to do whatever they want with that entitlement". That may still sound like a good shift, but even if the contrast is exaggerated, it does (I think) bring out some of the more difficult aspects of the shift.

For completeness I will just mention a couple of other obstacles that struck me. First, there are some cost of delivery issues (e.g. the cost of the consumer brokers mentioned above, fragmentation of service provision and loss of economies of scale etc).  But this argument strikes me as increasingly irrelevant, since in a connected world the costs and the lost opportunities should be minimal. Second, there are issues about risk-taking and safety nets. To some extent this is a variant on the appropriate use issue, but what happens if a service user opts for a high cost, intensive service in the hope that this will dramatically reduce subsequent needs and then this hope is disappointed? Is there a basic level of service entitlement that cuts back in if someone's budget is exhausted (perhaps for reasons reflecting quite reasonable choices on their part)? Finally, there is the thought that the people who get helped most by this kind of shift are the financially better off. I suppose in part this reflects the fact that direct provision is a form of rationing, i.e. some kind of service is provided and those who can afford a better service opt out and pay for that service themselves.  In a more cash-entitlement based world the assumption would be that pretty much everyone would take up their entitlement (so either the overall cost of provision goes up or the less well enough get less provision).

So a few thoughts on the difficulties of empowerment and perhaps a clear sign that I have not yet managed to fully shake off my civil servant, supplier-side mentality. But at least my use of a split infinitive in the previous sentence shows I am trying! Interested to know what others think.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>While I can generally get behind the overarching notion of empowering users of state-supported services, the question of which services this might encompass must pass real and meaningful tests associated with reasonableness, eligibility, measurable results and value for money.

Particularly in the case of disability and mental health, how does the creation of a voucher system not create more bureaucracy rather than less?  Would the services already being delivered need to be compromised in order to fund such added administration?  Most importantly, how would this kind of so-called empowerment enhance the outcomes for those who use such services?  Without answering these questions, particularly the last, this paper is long on ideology and short on addressing the specific and very real challenges associated with what the World Health Orhganization has called "an unheralded global crisis in mental health".  

Mental illness is the single leading cause of human disability in the world yet it receives a fraction of research and state funding.  In Australia, as in many countries, it accounts for a single-digit percentage of the health budget.

This kind of underfunding (and Australia is by no means alone) has only exacerbated the toll in human life and suffering; mental illness kills and not just by suicide, (90% of which have diagnosable mental illnesses) but also its often co-occurence with heart disease and other chronic ailments for example.  95% of homeless people are estimated to have some form of mental illness.  In the order of 75% of all short and long term disability claims are related to mental illness  One has to ask what positive impact this particular agenda could have on any of this. 

It's an interesting choice for the author to single this particular area out as one which would somehow benefit from the regime he posits...as the author notes, the politcal opposition is far more potent elsewhere in the health system, so that may be a clue... perhaps the answer to who might become the "consumer intermediaries" central to the approach might be another.

I imagine you've guessed by now that I'm not sold on this approach as one which supports the ideals and aspirations of either "empowerment" or of  "the connected republic".</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Just to push back a little...
1  I appreciate that blind faith in human nature can be dangerous, but to assume that people with mental illness or their carers will rush off to the Caribbean instead of using the resources to help their condition is a little unfair (even if it's possible to find some examples, as you would in pretty much any public welfare program I guess).  I appreciate that good policy making has to consider the outlier problems, but to use that kind of extreme 'what if' as an argument against the basic proposal is maybe a bit tough.  
2  Vouchers of course are the traditional answer to Paul's criticism that people who recieve public funding for particular conditions will abuse the system and waste the resources.  But Terry is right that vouchers bring with them a bureaucracy of their own,. So the issue here is, at least in part, if you have to have a bureaucracy, isn't it better that as far as possible it is used to administer a system in which consumers or their representatives have much greater power and authority over what happens to them?  I think that's the essence of Vern's thesis.
3  As a general rule, I'm more comfortable with the proposition that those with needs we're trying to help are better judges of what  will be in their best interests that relatively distant and disinterested bureaucrats, no matter how well you write the guidelines. That's not to say that such people (as with the rest of us) don't sometimes make decisions that clearly are not in our best interests (drink too much, take drugs, work too hard etc), but over the long haul we tend to be the best judges.  It might be a little naive, romantic even, but my problem is the consequences of not accepting that premise.
4 Of course, a true liberal might suggest that both direct funding and vouchers are simply alternative forms of 'churn', in which we tax people and then hand them back their money through programs and services around which we have to write all sorts of complex, cumbersome rules and in the process of which we inevitably create all sorts of systemic frictions which mean we waste money, time and energy to get the job done.  The simplest way to fix that is to take less tax off them in the first place and allow them to spend their own money in ways best calculated to advance their interests - pretty much like most of the rest of us in most of the rest of our lives.
5 Terry is spot on about the chronic underfunding of mental health.  Vern Hughes is driven by very much that concern, as well as some personal encounters, through some family issues in the mental health field, with the current supply-side system of service design and delivery.  His motivation is much the same as Terry's I suspect - not so much ideological as an attempt to open up the debate about possible solutions borne primarily of personal frustration with the status quo.
6  Leaving aside whether you agree with ithe specifics of his proposal, I would have thought that Vern's instincts in search of a different moel are very much in tune with TCR:2 - empower the edge? The power of us?  My take on his paper was that here was one attempt to put those principles into action and use them as part of a new approach to service design.  
7  I also think the paper is very Web:2 in iits values - co-production, much greater opportunity for consumers to influence the design and delivery of services etc etc.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I certainly share Martin's view that the idea that people will take off to the Caribbean, rather than use funds for their intended purpose is an unfair characterization, though I understand the intent of Paul's statement.

There is no such thing as a 100% elimination of abuse, no matter what model we may be speaking of.  There are however, many ways in which elgibility can be better and more consistently determined and to me, that's where this has to start.  

To be sure, I disagree with the target audience being chosen, as it represent a group of citizens, stakeholders, constituents who are in a societally vulnerable and exposed place.  It's further compounded by the underfunding that's been discussed and of course, this creates a different political dynamic (the lack of political oppostion that the paper refers to, reflects much, including lack of cash).

Notwithstanding all of this, is this a good example of TCR2?  I continue to think not.  The only way in which the power of us and the empowering of the edge can truly happen is to have a strong centre, supported by political and bureaucratic leadership, appropriate funding, controls and value for money analyses.  it may seem paradoxical but without a pragmatic view to "empowering the core", politcal footballs such as this will only cause dismay and disenchantment, not to mention having the potential to actually reduce the quality of service and outcome for those who are most in need.  Choosing the wrong group at this juncture will ultimately prove to the naysayers that this kind of thing (the ideals of TCR2 and the embracing of Web2.0) can't work in the public context.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Martin has already blogged on the specialist session we did recently on Government 2.0, but I thought people might be interested to hear some of the excellent debate for themselves. So we have now put short podcasts of the opening presentations on the public services summit <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le21/le34/nobel/2007/podcasts.html" target="_blank">event website</a>.

What was fascinating about the session (and the podcasts) is how each presenter approached the issue in their own way with a slightly different perspective on what the greatest potential benefits of Web 2.o for the public sector were. Geoff Mulgan was really interested in the scope for innovation at the edge and around public sector organisations; Hugh McPhail was excited by the potential for opening up government through greater transparency; while Joanne Caddy focussed on the issue of participation. It was also interesting to see the different takes on the obstacles to Government 2.0. Here I thought that Tom Bentley's contribution was particularly interesting with his analysis of the three forces holding back Web 2.0 type approaches - secrecy, silos and surprise. So a fascinating set of views that I hope people will enjoy and certainly a set of issues that we are likely to keep coming back to in the different parts of this site.

PS If you explore the rest of the site, you may notice that we are doing a bit of a revamp  in order to encourage more user participation. Do feel free to get involved or to make comments on how the site could be improved. Further changes coming in the next two weeks.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[There have been quite a few posts on this blog about the Public Services Summit last December, but for me the highlight of the event was David Weinberger’s inspirational presentation The Realism of the Web. How can you not love a guy who begins his talk by saying that he does not think the web has been hyped enough? It’s a fantastic presentation and captures some really important things about how the Web opens up new possibilities and changes the way we need to think about things.

David focuses on three aspects of the Web - generosity, intimacy, and (acceptance of) fallibility - and celebrates them as enabling more truly human forms of interaction. He emphasizes how knowledge emerges from conversation (rather than meditation) and how peer-to-peer collaboration can be at least as productive as top-down organisation.  Of course, there is still a role for meditation and for organisation, but the excitement of the connected world is the phenomenally expanded role for conversation and collaboration. As David's talk makes abundantly clear, the danger is not that we will over-estimate the impact of the web but that we become blase about it. Every now and then we need to listen to someone like David and remind ourselves just how exciting the possibilities are!

The presentation is available (100 mega file) on <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le21/le34/nobel/2007/videos.html" target="_blank">the event website</a>, but I have also put it on YouTube - broken down (as YouTube requires) into ten-minute bites. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[How's this for an understatement...."despite significant progress (in eGovernment), transforming the deeper structures of government is proving to be an intractable challenge." Really?  What a surprise.

The insight comes at the start of a great blog from Don Tapscott at Davos where, in a moment of impromptu madness by all accounts, he convened a quick seminar on the challenges of "government 2.0".  His report suggests the discussion buzzed and sizzled with exciting discussion and considerable passion as people grappled with the deep and uncertain forces that are already causing many of the traditional patterns and behaviours of government and democracy to stretch to breaking point. 

Tapscott runs through 9 themes from the discussion - go and have a read to get a flavour of the full list - <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/tapscott">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/tapscott</a>.  Here's just a couple of quickies...

Self-organisation - "people outside the boundaries of traditional institutions have at their fingertips the most powerful tool ever for organizing collective action. But the so-called “smart mobs” and “wise crowds” of the past are being superseded by movements for social change on an unprecedented scale. This is not simply occurring within nation states, where the third pillar of society (after corporations and governments)-the civil society-has historically addressed the needs of communities that have not been met by the market or government. Increasingly, “the people” are organizing across borders and exerting their power and influence on the global scene.  This has big implications for governments."  Must be a blogging thing to resort to these kinds of deflating understatements!  Implications indeed.  What Tapsott is describing is the rise of the "non state pbulic sector" or the "public purpose" sector as i saw it once described by US writer Lisbeth Schorr.  What this refers to is the increasingly motivation and capacity for people to organise for common, public purpose without resorting to, or relying on, the instruments and resources of the structured state.

Here another - "past technological paradigms-the printing press, broadcast media, and the centralized model of the computer-were hierarchical, immutable and centralized. As such they carried the values of their powerful owners. By contrast, the web 2.0 is interactive, enriched with services, and distributed in control. As such it possesses an awesome neutrality - reflecting what is good and bad in society. Religious fundamentalists, terrorists, hackers and criminal networks have harnessed the power of mass collaboration to promote hate and commit heinous acts. The key to global security and freedom may lie in harnessing this same power."  Indeed - the network is part of the solution to the problems it creates. 

Tapscott ends with this observation -  "if there really is a new paradigm in government emerging – a government 2.0 – how can such a change occur?  New paradigm’s are received with coolness, hostility and vested interests fight change.  This will be an enormous challenge to move to a new model and require leadership."  That's true.  It's also not especially original and has been the subject of considerale discussion in many jurisdictions around the world.  We took some of these concerns apart at the recent Nobel Summit in Stockholm where our government 2.0 speakers, including Geoff Mulgan, brought some welcome measure and deep insight to the discussion.

Tapscott's nine point are a great way into a discussion which will not go away.  The very purpose, role and indeed existence of the public sector, at least in some measure, are all at stake.  Like the man said, an intractable challenge...]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>As something of an adjunct to Martin's piece, here's an article from Don Tapscott's collaborator,  Tony Williams.  Tony ends his piece (much of which resonates in the TCR community) stating that we're "in a new golden age of democracy".  While I think there is real and meaningful hope for that being the case, such statements cause me concern, for their implicit high-mindedness, not to mention providing a context for what democracy actually means in the world today...

Government 2.0:  Wikinomics and the Challenge to Government
by Anthony D. Williams

Today, thanks largely to the internet, the kind of creativity and innovation that used to take place primarily within the confines of corporate walls now occurs across large, loosely connected networks of firms and individual entrepreneurs. 

Already, millions of people have joined forces in self-organized collaborations that have produced dynamic innovations in goods and services rivaling the world’s largest and best-financed enterprise networks. If masses of ordinary people can peer-produce an operating system (Linux), an encyclopedia (Wikipedia), the media (YouTube/Current TV), a mutual fund, and even a physical thing such as a motorcycle, one should carefully consider what might come next. 

Arguably, this vast global network of specialized producers who swap and exchange services for entertainment, sustenance and learning is becoming an economy unto itself. 

But what does Wikinomics entail for government and how will mass collaboration transform the business of delivering public services and the nature of democracy? Could societies “open source” government much the way thousands of dispersed Linux programmers converged on the internet to develop one of the world’s leading computer operating systems? Would large-scale, web-enabled consultations improve political decision-making or channel greater ingenuity and urgency into efforts to solve global challenges like terrorism and climate change? What about the provision of public services: could public agencies use ongoing collaboration with citizens, civil society and the private sector to achieve better results at a lower cost? 

Research conducted at the Toronto-based think tank New Paradigm suggests that the answer is “yes” to all of the above (see sidebar). Indeed, a confluence of technological, demographic, social and economic forces holds the promise and the inevitability of new models for delivering the functions of government – call it Government 2.0. 

It’s time for governments to stop paving the cow paths – that is, focusing on automating existing processes and moving existing government services online. The emerging “age of participation” presents an historic occasion to fundamentally redesign how government operates, how and what the public sector provides, and ultimately, how governments interact and engage with their citizens.

Accelerating service transformation
After decades of effort and investment, governments that once supplied standard transactional services through a fragmented public bureaucracy are increasingly providing citizens and other stakeholders with a single window to public services. But as new waves of innovation wash over the internet, it is time for governments to move up the capability ladder yet again. Once the sine qua non of e-government, single window service offerings constitute one-way information flows to the citizen and are no longer sufficient in a world where customers are increasingly accustomed to participating in dynamic online communities such as Facebook, YouTube and Wikipedia. 

The new function-rich infrastructure of the Web 2.0 provides public agencies with significant opportunities to infuse innovation into the business of delivering services. For example, the age-old question of “who does what” can now be answered more creatively than ever before. Public services need no longer be provided by government alone; they can be provided by any combination of public agencies, the private sector, community groups, or citizens, using the web as a mechanism for collaboration, innovation and engagement. 

Public service providers seeking to target young people can use web services and widgets to syndicate the delivery of services and information through new venues such as Facebook and YouTube. And, new waves of mobile and pervasive computing will enable governments to deliver highly individualized “anytime, anywhere” services to a generation of young users that increasing accesses the web through cell phones and mobile computing devices. 

Enabling a 21st century work environment

The stereotypical image of public sector employment as home to rigid, repetitive and hierarchically-managed work environments must change if governments wish to remain competitive in the battle for talent. All too often, young employees arrive in the public sector workplace and are dismayed to discover that many of the applications and devices they are accustomed to using in their personal lives are not available for them to use professionally.

Drawing on their experience on sites such as Facebook and YouTube, young government professionals have organized their own ad hoc communities that transcend departmental and organizational boundaries using blogs, wikis, and social networking tools. More often than not, their enterprising, under-the-radar efforts have been stamped out by senior managers who cite as justification concerns about data security, legal constraints, or fears that sensitive information could leak out to the public. 

Some leading agencies in the United States have seen past these constraints and are demonstrating how Web 2.0 technologies can promote knowledge sharing, better communication, increased collegiality and cross-departmental collaboration. For example, the US Department of State’s Diplopedia provides a living repository of organizational knowledge and enables foreign service officials to share vital information with colleagues around the world. Similarly, the Director of National Intelligence created Intellipedia, a wikified (but highly secured) intelligence portal, to promote better intelligence gathering and sharing across a variety of federal intelligence agencies. Both the Department of State and leaders within national intelligence community have noted the important role these technologies play in building bridges between the incoming generation of young employees and their senior peers.

Preparing for digital-era policymaking
In most countries, policymaking has always been a static, top-down process. Politicians study issues, seek counsel from a select group of advisors, deliberate and enact laws on the population’s behalf. Most citizens are on the periphery, playing no role other than casting a ballot every few years. 

Times have changed. Web 2.0 technologies can make the process of engaging citizens in policymaking easier and less costly than ever before by providing tools to support knowledge creation and community building, two core aspects of digital-era policymaking. 

For example, government agencies can post background information on the web and use online videoconferencing to bring in expert testimony. Web-enabled forums can provoke discussion and debate among hundreds, thousands and even millions of geographically dispersed participants. Wikis provide a platform for collaborative editing of policy documents, while social-networking technologies can connect citizens and organizations with common goals and interests. 

Networked Knowledge California (NKCA), for example, illustrates what can be done when simple web-based tools transform raw public data into formats that are meaningful and useful to community residents and local-government policymakers. Research shows that tax delinquency, unpaid utility bills, mortgage defaults, building-code violations and tenant complaints all start to climb well before buildings are eventually abandoned and neighborhoods slip into decline. Spotted early enough, a community's decay can be reversed through a combination of well-targeted public programs and private-sector investment. But although the danger signals are all on public record, they’re typically inaccessible to the public, buried deep within the bowels of city hall.

Through an intuitive web-based interface, NKCA knits together municipal databases and inspection records, looks for indicators of urban decay, and plots the information on local and state-level maps posted online. Rather than having to look at each database separately, public officials, citizens and businesses can search by zip code or other parameters to view comprehensive information on one property, or see at a glance which communities might be headed for trouble. 

Private-sector developers can now spot potential investment opportunities such as a cluster of buildings in financial difficulty, while community organizations are using the NKCA as a tool for community empowerment. NKCA even has a code-enforcement tracking system that lets residents monitor the City of Los Angeles’ responses to housing-code complaints and violations similar to the way online customers track their FedEx packages. Data that might otherwise have gone unused in filing cabinets is suddenly a catalyst for better policymaking, more effective local government and neighborhood economic development

Overcoming the crisis of leadership
Transforming the structures of government from command-and-control hierarchies to innovative and agile networks of public and private participants is proving to be a major challenge. Deep and resilient legacies combine to frustrate progress. Common obstacles to change include conflicting timeframes and motives, particularly between the public service and politicians; a lack of incentives to innovate; and the absence of urgency in many quarters. 

Persuasion has long been one of government’s most crucial powers and public leaders will be called upon to master the art. Persuading agencies to experiment with Web 2.0 technologies and new strategies for delivering services; persuading managers that social networking technologies are not a distraction but an essential tool in today’s workplace; persuading customers that data sharing will result in greater convenience and higher quality services – these are just some of the challenges for which leaders must plan. 

It is truly a time when either government plays an active and positive role in its own transformation, or change will happen to it. The transformation process is at the same time exhilarating and painful, but the price of inaction is a lost opportunity for government to redefine its role in a new golden age of democracy.

<wp:comment_content>This kind of writing is alluring and annoying in equal measure.  Alluring because he’s partly right and is clearly picking up the same signals and trends that many others are, ourselves included.  Annoying though because in many ways the analysis misses the point, which is to describe how any of these changes or new capabilities adds up to truly transformed government.  How much of this story is really all about doing government, traditional government, better (faster, smoother, more inclusively)?  

The story will get interesting when it confronts some big questions – how any of this changes the role and purpose of government, how any of this ushers in a whole new way to tackle the ‘public’ work that we have assumed is the natural and exclusive territory of the public sector or traditional government and how any of this unsettles and redraws the underlying contours of power, authority and accountability on which the whole edifice is based in the first place.  

Anything else is incremental and essentially ‘embroidery’ on a relatively unchanged canvass (to mangle a few innocent metaphors!).  Nothing wrong with incremental embroidery and making government work better.  Indeed, some might be uncharitable and speculate whether all of this so-called transformation isn’t much more than government getting on and doing what it should be doing anyway.  

When we met at the Nobel Summit and canvassed the prospect of Government 2.0, I  was struck by the contest between the romantic and the realist frame that people brought to the debate, and depending on which you choose or feel more comfortable with, you will get very different answers about the potential of these trends and new capabilities and their implications.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Times New Roman">This was originally going to be a comment on Martin’s “An Intractable Challenge!” piece where he takes a look at some recent thoughts from Don Tapscott.  However, it got a bit too long for a comment, so instead ended up here.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">As Martin notes, it is quite an understatement for Don to say that the idea of government 2.0 has profound implications for the public sector. He then points to the idea of an emerging “public purpose sector” as perhaps crystallising some of the change we are seeing or urging in government, and concludes by noting that interesting discussions can be had around the often seemingly intractable nature of the challenges that surround this change.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Processes of public sector change are frequently slow, tortuous and prone to be more limited, partial or fragile than one might wish. However, maybe they’re not so intractable if we take a longer perspective and don't regard the state as a concrete entity instead of an abstract idea or concept. If the state is simply a reflection of the social contract under which people surrender certain rights to governments, and the public sector is something they get in return, then it is interesting to ask whether real, profound, change depends upon a change in the will of the people? </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">At least in the west, the development of government throughout the 20th century closely mirrored the development of modern business in the 19th; both in terms of what drove it and what forms it took. Western institutions of representative democracy, public governance and public service very much reflected the ideas of specialisation of labour and economies of scale.  The ‘machine bureaucracy’ was the public manifestation of this revolution in economic ideas and, given the capabilities governments had available, was the (perhaps) inevitable and obvious response to the realities of governing emerging nation states.  Whether this really reflected the will of the people or not is an interesting question, given that they really did not have that great a say in things. Any ‘voice’ they had was largely subsumed and mediated by their new-found representatives. But it could be argued that simply because people generally went along with this process of change it did, implicitly, reflect their will. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">From say the French Revolution onwards what we see is increasing scale of the populations and geographies to be governed as nation states, the complexity of interests to be addressed and challenges to be faced, the physical resources required to be effective, and the information required to make it all work. At the same time economies developed in ways that required the majority of populations to either persist in working in agriculture or switch into the new occupations brought about by industrialisation. Again, they did not have any great say in this process driven by political and business elites. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">During this time there has also developed an increased capacity to create models and categorise things in ways that allowed the complex and messy world to be reduced down to simpler elements that seemed predictable and open to rational influence (or so we thought). And so the ideas and techniques that would eventually inform ‘modern’ public administration (and later public management) were slowly born, used, refined and popularised.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">While the public was able to influence some of this huge change (e.g. the idea of workers rights and the 40 hour week) there was no mass demand for a new social contract that in turn would have led to some redefinition of the state and its institutions and organisations.  People had other things on their minds, and change occurred at the margin. During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, when people weren’t coping with the Great Depression, falling victim to ‘isms (communism, fascism etc) or being made to fight world wars they were enjoying the benefits of an unprecedented 60 years of economic expansion off the back of WW2.  </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">A rising tide lifts all boats doesn’t it? In the west we felt we were doing pretty darned well thank you. We had more of all the good things in life and little visibility of the costs – the alarmist Club of Rome really just wanted to rain on the parade! The latter part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century simply did not generate any great popular wave of interest in things such as participation or engagement in government (merely achieving universal suffrage was a huge advance in western countries even as late as the 1970s) or more effective provision of public services. And even if there had been significant demand it could not have been expressed effectively. The mass media was privately owned, broadcast in nature, and inaccessible to the general public. Costs of inter-personal communication were high, so expressing a view in public was much more difficult compared to today. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">So the will of the people did not really change in any fundamental way and government wasn’t interested anyway. Politicians did not generally see merit in greater public involvement in public life - as Churchill said “the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter”. Public officials were no better – their ability to monopolise voice and information bestowed great advantages in terms of power, prestige, and material and psychological well-being that they would never willingly allow the unruly mob of citizens out there to diminish. Of course many just wanted to be good public servants.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">This was all very well, and by the 1990s western society was in possession of some of the best expressions of ‘industrial age government’ possible. People didn’t complain too much - most were just busy trying to live their lives - and seemed to hold little desire or expectation of ‘transformational change’. Instead of really reflecting the will of the people, which largely had to express itself except through crude mechanisms such as voting and the occasional bout of civil unrest, government just got better and better at deciding for itself what the people wanted and then delivering it to (or inflicting it on) them.  </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">In many ways the first wave of e-government just added to this, giving government new tools with which to do the same old thing. Of course, in many cases ideas of improved participation, openness or transparency were bolted on to e-government but public officials neither knew what that really meant nor welcomed it, and their political masters did not seem very interested anyway (why would they be – they had a monopoly to protect).  On the outside, citizens who had access to the Internet were too busy learning about the joys of e‑commerce and new media content to have time to think about how they might use the Internet to change their world. And anyway, getting content onto the web took time and skills that most did not possess and once it was there it was all pretty flat anyway – all that reading took time.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">And so by the beginning of this century what had the public got in the end from their social contracts?  I believe that, as we are now beginning to see, the public was poorly served.  Governments made remarkably crude decisions of their behalf in every sphere from foreign affairs through to economic development and social and environmental policy. They permitted themselves to think that their monopoly on voice and information also bestowed a monopoly on wisdom and that decision‑making at the level of broad aggregates (labour markets, geographical regions, gender, ethnicity, age cohorts etc) was appropriate. Treating the public as a largely undifferentiated mass was quite alright in an era of mass production and consumption. In an environment where the public had little voice, and governments had macro economies (again an abstract concept, not a reality) to run, complexity and variety were easily enough extracted away so that tough decisions could be made relatively efficiently. Too bad it didn’t work. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Now we live in the era of Web 2.0 which we also call the participative Internet.  I think this is the real information revolution (unlike Web 1.0) and that it is doing two very big things. First, it is amplifying our individual and collective awareness and cognitive capabilities, allowing us to see and understand more explicitly what we’ve always implicitly known (or should have known): everything is local, there is a fundamental connection of everything to everything else, people are all different, not the same, and the world is really complex. We can now see the chickens borne of our crude public decisions coming home to roost – the environment is in peril, our traditional energy supplies are dwindling, our societies are fragmenting and our economies look like they are collapsing etc. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">The fact that we can see all this more clearly is not because it is just now beginning to happen. Instead, now that we are increasingly able to access, use and participate in the “human network” that the Internet enables we simply have vastly more information available in real time to show us what is happening around us. We also have the potential to (re)gain our voice. Politicians and public officials cannot prohibit, monopolise or control information or voice as they once could (some say a major contributor to the fall of the Soviet Union was the handycam and the VCR) and people know it. And out of this new awareness is emerging an understanding, especially among the young, that our institutions of government are failing us and that change must happen. So perhaps the will of the people is now changing, and a new social contract may be in the offing.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">The other big thing is that the network is empowering people to make those changes in so many different ways, from creating and sharing their own information about what is happening in their worlds with anyone who cares to listen (and many who do not), to taking responsibility and addressing issues in their own lives and communities in ways that are so much more reflective of and responsive to their situation and needs than industrial era government could ever hope to be. The old requirement for economies of scale is breaking down in the face of Moore’s law and the shift of capital intensive activities from the public to the private sector.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">So to me, the “human network” is like a genie that a new technology has let out of a bottle. We often ask ourselves what is it about the network that means governments should support its continued extension and adoption in the public sphere. Surely it isn’t just because it can make government 1.0 run better, faster and cheaper with a bit more openness - a good but not compelling story. The best answer for government may be that an unstoppable change has already started. The public is unconsciously moving toward a new and more dynamic social contract where the state plays a different role in a different and more flexible way (i.e. it is transformed). People still need government, and they need it to be legitimate. For government to remain legitimate it must embrace and support this change, which I guess is one of the key ideas of the Connected Republic 2.0. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">So I don’t regard the types of challenges Tapscott sets out as intractable - especially if we take a historical view of change and don’t expect that government should or will drive change its own. What they are is very difficult to deal with for those who currently sit inside the old paradigm of industrial age government. They are also big and complex, and need government leadership – it is in nobody’s interest for those responsible for government 1.0 to simply surrender and say “do it your way, what do we know?”.  We don’t want babies thrown out with the bathwater – there is no need or time for that.  However, if today’s public leaders are open to the idea that change is already underway, that there are new players in the game (i.e. the public, and also the younger people within own institutions), that they do not to entirely own and control the processes and that things could get better, not worse, then anything could happen. Couldn’t it?</font>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>One interesting issue for me in this is whether (or to what extent) citizens have permanently out-sourced government to politicians and civil servants. Like you, I think there are great opportunities now to empower citizens and I think citizens will take a lot of those up, but I still think we need to be realistic about how much time the average citizen is going to be prepared to devote in this area. Obviously at different times in people's lives the time and effort they are prepared to make available will vary (and some people will generally be inclined to contribute more), but while I hope we will see an upward trend in people's preparedness to get involved, some of this will need to reflect the fact that it is much easier for them to get involved rather than a massive increase in the time and effort they devote to this portion of their lives.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Paul's right - as he often is.  The surge of citizen engagement will be constrained perhaps by Oscar Wilde's dictum that socialism would never take off because there weren't enough Tuesday nights (for people to attend the interminable public meetings on which the entire proces relies).
However, Russell's great review of the way we got to where we have arrived also reminds us that, to soe extent, what web 2.0 and the rest is offering is the chance for people to engage not with government or turgic public meetings with political party bosses but with each other or at least with other more flexible and attractive opportunities to connect and interact.  Maybe part of the debate should be about the fact that what it means to engage in 'public' activities itself is dramatically changing.  More and more of what we need and want to do 'in public' will not require petitioning a distant and disinterested government agency or politician.  We can be public in much more interesting and lively and effective ways which, in turn, might see a growth in the interest in beng 'public' at all (which is what the evidence suggests youngee people are already demonstrating as they become engaged in the big issues that matter to them using the new cool and groovy tools of the connected age in whihc they thrive.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Two excellent points.

I agree with Paul that we should not expect that people will now wish to engage much more directly, actively or frequently with government just because they have greater capaity to do so. There will always be those who can't or won't engage with government via any medium. 

So government must be quite sophisticated about how it opens up to new modes of engagement and careful not to mistake those who do for being representative of public attitudes and desires - silence does not equal agreement or assent assent.

(As an aside, Peter Cook made a great satire called The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer  looking at what could go wrong if the public was offered direct democracy - see http://www.britmovie.co.uk/genres/comedy/filmography01/058.html)

Martin's quote from Wilde is most apposite, reminding agin to not expect the public to engage just because they can - there really are other things to spend time on. 

I also appreciate the point that we must not to simply see government 2.0 as its predecessor on steroids. We are presented with a great opportunity to conceive of government in new and different ways.

Good stuff</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Intractable, yes.   However, as suggested, the will of the people most often prevails and the next generation of citizen will most likely demand the new type of services promised by Web 2.0.  Our children, and our children’s children, will demand this level of interaction with those providing services whether it’s public sector, healthcare, or pizza delivery.  This is evident to me having observed the on-line activities of the 2nd grade class at San Ramon Elementary.

As much as we would like to see public sector evolution accelerate to the speed of technology, the government plods along at a glacial pace measured in lifetimes (or at least administrations) and not fiscal quarters.  While this may be the next wave of the information revolution, let’s keep in perspective that we are really at the infancy of the technologies and ways that people will take advantage of them.  The government, not known for taking a leading role in the adoption of such falls somewhere behind the rest of industry.  But I remain cautiously optimistic, the “IPv6 Mandate” by OMB has all the trappings of leadership, but apparently not the clout to make it happen.

While I agree with Paul that there will always be those who can’t or won’t engage with government via any medium, but it’s a process and time will tell.  According to Internet World Stats, of the estimated 302 million Americans in 2007, 211 million of them (70 percent) are using the Internet. This represents 19 percent of the estimated 1.11 billion Internet users worldwide. In contrast, Americans make up only about 5 percent of the world’s total population.18 The Internet is becoming an important part of the everyday lives of Americans. As of early 2007, parents spent an average of 33 hours per month (about one hour per day) using the Internet, and children between the ages of 8 and 14 spend over 19 hours per month online.

According to a study from early 2007, about 31 million U.S. households (29 percent of the total number of U.S. households) did not have Internet access and did not plan to obtain Internet access over the next year. A survey of these households asked why they were not interested in getting Internet access and found that 44 percent were not interested in anything on the Internet, 17 percent were not sure how to use the Internet, 14 percent had Internet access at work, 14 percent could not afford a computer, 8 percent could not afford service, and 3 percent said Internet service was not available for their home.

So we face some challenges, interacting with the public sector needs to be for –everyone- not just those privileged enough to have access to the Internet at the moment. 

The number of people willing to participate will increase as we provide them with the necessary (easy to use) tools and technologies.  How about a free national wireless network for the entire US?  Socialized networking?

We have a long way to go…</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[New Zealand's prime minister has found herself in the middle of a minor political bloodbath over revelations that a government owned business is involved in erecting cell phone towers in Burma.

The opposition foreign affairs spokesman said "It is hard to reconcile these actions with the decision to allow a wholly taxpayer-owned company to carry out engineering work for the Butchers of Burma especially when it is likely that the communications facilities they are constructing will be used as a tool for the continued suppression of the Burmese people," (Ouch - low blow!)

In response, the PM claimed that "Quite frankly I think that's probably an aid to democracy in Myanmar, not a step backwards, because one of the ways of getting news out to the world and photos and images out to the world is precisely through that technology." (Nice save?).

The full story is here <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4386805a6009.html">http://www.stuff.co.nz/4386805a6009.html</a> I think it raises an interesting question. Sadly, it also shows that there is as much knuckle dragging in NZ politics as anywhere else.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Nice story to illustrate that connectedness, and the technology on which it relies, is neither good nor bad  it's what people chose to do with it, fired by whatever moral purpose they have and harnessed to whatever purpose.  I'm inclined to support the move to put the towers up.  Even if the Burmese junta thinks it can press the new capability for better communications to its own purposes, the record suggests they won't succeed in repressing the instincts for openness enabled by the same towers, the same platform.  In the end, the network routes around any obstacle you put in its path.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I'm sure that these types of claims were leveled at the Gutenberg press almost 600 years ago.  Earning cheap political points is the domain of those bereft of ideas, who'd rather prey on fear, not hope.  Genuinely shameful, but sadly not the sole domain of NZ mouth-breathers...

It does beg a question around what kind of  fiery "we must limit technology to save us from ourselves" rhetoric we've yet to hear.  

Related to this, there was a piece on the Generative Internet a few months ago and I'll post it.  In a nutshell though, it says that one of the biggest threats to to the future of the internet is the rise of tethered devices (those which can't be modified by their users).  

Given real and lasting concerns around internet security, not to mention fears for how it might be "used against us", the same "save us from ourself" crowd is receiving a sympathetic ear from those who'd like to control the future use of the internet, as well as those who want to profit from it (not necessarilly the same people of course)...</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Anyone with an interest in education in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) should download and read a recent report from the World Bank entitled: <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html">The Road Not Traveled - Education Reform in the Middle East and Africa</a>. Indeed, anyone with an interest in the development of education globally will find much to think about here.<br><br>Like any report from the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>, this paper is replete with an incredibly rich and fascinating mass of statistics as well as formidable analysis of social and economic trends. However, it is also admirably (I almost wrote 'surprisingly') thoughtful in its discussion both of broader trends in educational thought and practice across the globe and of the implications of such trends for education in this impatient and learning-hungry region. It ranges across primary, secondary, vocational and higher education, and paints a picture of a swathe of countries that have expended, and are expending, much effort and no little resource in attempting to generate real educational opportunities for their citizens (but a very mixed picture, of course, in so many respects, in terms of broader social, gender and political opportunities). The report, basically, looks at 'what next': how can countries in the region take further decisive steps towards achieving a higher quality and greater relevance in education at all levels?<br><br>The authors of the paper take a particular approach to improving a national education system, an approach that seeks to produce better 'engineering' of education, better motivation of the actors involved, and better public accountability of policy makers to citizens.<em> </em><em><br><br>"Better engineering involves providing the necessary level and mix of inputs to achieve the objectives of education by means of effective management and adequate resources. Better incentives go beyond compensation to issues of evaluation, monitoring, and information. Finally, better public accountability involves giving parents/students voice to influence educational policies and resource allocation."<br><br></em>While the systems-like approach taken here might jar with some, there is no doubt that, for many parts of this disparate region, a seriously concerted effort is needed to push forward with further and effective reforms of education systems. Many countries, the report acknowledges, have already relied heavily on 'an engineering perspective' in getting their education systems to where they are now. As the paper says:<br><br><em>"What is surprising is that they have not as yet gone far enough in the direction of relying more systematically and coherently on measures of incentives and public accountability. The engineering approach probably served the region reasonably well earlier, when it was necessary for the government to take the lead on establishing a new education system, with a new structure and administration, new curricula and textbooks, a new professional teacher corps and administrative staff, and a command and control apparatus. However, the expectations from education have changed over time, for both internal and external reasons. The strong preference for the engineering perspective is starting to show its limits and strains. The path taken so far is no longer what is needed going forward. Thus a shift in orientation is needed."</em><em> </em><br><br>An 'engineering' approach is necessary but not sufficient to achieve the level of change and reform required in many countries today.<br><br>So:<em><br><br>"...all over the world, the organization of education systems is changing on pedagogical (student-centered and competency-based learning), structural (lifelong learning), financing (diversification of funding), and managerial (decentralization and coordination) fronts to keep pace with the changing place of human capital in the development equation. Hence, the success of future education reform programs will require a change in tack. It will require a sharing of responsibility among sector authorities, potential service providers, and civil society. In other terms, it will require a new balance of engineering, incentives, and public accountability."</em><em> </em><br><br>The World Bank, as might be expected, sees education as primarily an instrument for improving 'human capital development'. Again, this might jar for some who read the 400 or so pages here. But no one should doubt that the reservoir of untapped potential in MENA could be opened up massively through an approach such as the World Bank advocates here, for all its reductive flaws. In time, and perhaps more quickly than will be the case for older and more developed (and just as highly 'engineered') education systems, a better educated population in some parts of MENA might be able to move on from an 'engineered' education system to one that is more about passion and ambition and development of the whole human than simply about ensuring that the education system and the labour market tick along, more or less, in tandem. I believe this could be an 'intended unintended consequence', in the medium to longer term, of such reform (as I have <a href="http://www.johnconnell.co.uk/blog/?p=299">tried to argue before</a>). As such, any country that managed this would surely act as a beacon for what other countries in this region could achieve?<em><br><br>"The modern history of education reform in MENA is a tale of brazen ambition, struggle against internal and external odds, unintended consequence, tactical error and success, accomplishment, and unfinished business. It is also the story of the interaction of competing visions of the purpose and ends of education, pitching global trends in education strategy and content against age-old education traditions. Along this tumultuous path, the region should indeed be proud of its accomplishments."</em><em> </em><br><br>I see evidence in my own work of the very ambition and struggle described here. And I certainly see a number of countries that, given the opportunity, could take massive strides in the next few years.<br><br>[Please note that this is cross-posted from my own blog at: www.johnconnell.co.uk/blog/. <!-- technorati tags end -->]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>It's probably a bit hard to ask 400 pages to be made clear in one blog posting, but I'm not entirely sure what the World Bank is actually proposing - more engineering, less engineering, more 'accountability', some 'decentralisation and coordination' (whatever that means)?  There's an interesting discussion here in Australia right now about the extent to which education policy and funding, and the investment in and implementation of the core technology infrastructure on which schools rely, should be undertaken on a much more overtly 'systems' or engineering basis.  Australia, whose education policy is fractured between one federal government (funding) and 8 State and Territory Governments (policy and operations of actual schools) might be said to have suffred from an overdose of non-engineering approaches.  It's going to be fascinating, as we enter an unprecedented period of all governments, national and state, all being from the Labor Party, to see if there is an appetite, matched by the policy and institutional stamina, to reverse some of the perceived shortcomings of that federal approach.</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Citizen empowerment should certainly be about opening up debates on public issues so more citizens can engage and shape them, but it is a topic that seems a bit neglected. Probably because people think it is too difficult (and maybe because those who currently control policy debates are happy to continue doing so!). A little while ago I came across an <a href="https://debatemapper.com/sf/home.aspx" target="_blank">interesting tool</a> which aims to help people collaboratively map debates. I was intrigued and while browsing <a href="http://www.idealgovernment.com/" target="_blank">another favourite site of mine</a>, which is strongly opposed to the UK government's plans for ID cards, it occurred to me that it would be interesting to try to develop a balanced map of this lively and heated debate. The driving forces behind each site (David Price and William Heath respectively) were both happy to play game and after a lot of work (mainly by David) an initial map of the debate is now available on the <a href="https://debatemapper.com/sf/home.aspx" target="_blank">site</a>.

Interestingly, we had slightly differing views on next steps. David believes that as more experts engage with the map, its quality and accuracy will steadily improve, so that even newcomers to the debate will quickly be able to see what parts of the debate are most important and where the real differences lie. The tool anyway has a capacity for people to rate elements of the argument, so this is also scope in this way for the wisdom of the crowds to shape the debate. So for David (if I have understood him correctly) the key issue is to go beyond the superficial yes vs no of much political debate and provide a map that really captures an argument in all its complexity and sophistication. For him (I think) a map needs to be fairly detailed if it is to be genuinely enlightening and so make a real contribution. And Web 2.0 enables this because a wide range of true experts can engage and so allow the real substance of an argument to emerge.

The opposite approach is taken on a very different site I came across today. At <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/monkeybrain/hq" target="_blank">Hey Monkeybrain!</a>  anyone can start a yes/no argument and others can pitch in with their views on one side or another. This is not quite what I was suggesting in relation to David's very impressive and sophisticated tool. Rather my interest was trying to capture the essence of a debate, so people could work out where they stood in relation to it and then compare where they stood with the positions of others. Obviously if you had a tool that could do that, the more people who used it, the better a picture you would get of where people stood on that issue.  And then exponents of the different aspects of the debate would know where they needed to strengthen their case or where their message was falling down etc. Or to put it another way the bits of an argument that convinced no one would be held up very clearly to the light.

As far as I can see, doing something like this would require using some templates, so you would lose the sophistication and fine quality that David wants, but perhaps get the simplicity that seems so important to me. And in both cases the shaping of the argument would be something that was done collaboratively. Anyway, here is an illustrative five stage template I draw up that could be used for any government proposal.

Stage One - are there good reasons to do something similar to the government proposal. Here there would be: Scope for user to enter as many reasons in favour as desired; Scope for user to rate each of the reasons in terms of how strongly they argue in favour of what the government proposes;  Scope for user to rate conclusion statement: I agree that there are good reasons to do something similar to what the government proposes.

Stage Two - are there good reasons to avoid doing anything similar to the government proposal. Again: Scope for the user to enter as many reasons against as desired; Scope for user to rate each of the reasons in terms of how strongly they argue against doing what the government proposes; Scope for user to rate conclusion statement: I agree that there are good reasons not to do anything similar to what the government proposes.

Stage Three - Overall Position. Here: Scope for user to rate conclusion statement: Overall I agree that the case is made for doing something similar to what the government proposes

Stage Four - Unnecesary Aspects of the government's proposal. Here: Scope for user to enter arguments that some feature of the government's proposals are unnecessary                                                                                                                              Scope to rate conclusion statement in relation to any particular feature.

Stage Five - Improvements to the government's proposals. Here: Scope for user to enter arguments in favour of modifying some features of the government's proposals; Scope to rate conclusion statement in relation to any suggested modification.

Anyway, I think this is a really interesting field and I would love to see some public authorities embracing it and experimenting!]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>I like the structure and logic of this approach.  One thought occurs to me, though, which is the government-centric nature of the whole process.  Essentially, this is about finding ways to make what the government wants to do more susceptible to community input and feedback. But it assumes that it is for governments to 'propose' and others to 'oppose' (or whatever they want to do once the government has started the process).  Presumably we need to figure out ways to allow others, other than the government, to be the 'proposers' and for governments (among others) to be the responders?  Does that make sense?  Part of the citizen engagement debate is about expanding the capacity for people and organisations to not only be the ones being consulted about the government's agenda, but to be able to determine, at least to some extent, what the agenda should be in the first place.</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Arial">I have just been reading a very timely <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/mindsonfire.pdf">article</a> by John Seely Brown and Richard P Adler about ‘social learning’. My reading coincided with a recent discussion I had with a colleague, Lee Simpson, about the use of VLEs in higher education. We both see VLEs being used primarily as repositories for lecture notes; for posting PowerPoint slides, or for turning acetates into electronic documents – all no more than putting books online. Academics are still the guardians of content. </font>

<font face="Arial">This is the worst case scenario, but all too familiar. Of course there are always the early adopters who are experimenting with second life, wikis and other web 2.0 tools while there are others who understand the power of ICT for bringing to life so many concepts that a text book cannot do. There are amazing online models and simulations that students and teachers can experiment with to enhance their learning, many using virtual versions of tools that students would be able to access rarely, if at all,  in the real world. </font>

<font face="Arial">What Seely Brown and Adler are saying is that it is the ‘power of us’ that transforms our capabilities for learning. Seely Brown has argued for many years about the role of informal learning in developing tacit knowledge in furthering our understanding, and his book the <a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=708http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=7087">Social Life of Information</a> demonstrates this quite convincingly. There is much evidence around to suggest that students who discuss their studies together perform better: they are socially constructing their knowledge through conversations and interactions with others. This is what Seely Brown and Adler call ‘social learning’. In the article they sum this up succinctly by describing the Cartesian view of knowledge and learning ‘<em>that has largely dominated the way education has been structured for over a hundred years</em>’ with the premise ‘<em>I think therefore I am</em>’ and contrast it with a view of social learning described by ‘<em>We participate, therefore we are</em>’. </font>

<font face="Arial">The notion of ‘<em>We</em> <em>participate, therefore we are’</em> “<em>shifts the focus of our attention from the content of a subject to the learning activities and human interactions around which that content is situated</em>”. In formal education, however, the focus is still strongly around content. Content that is deemed ‘suitable’ is validated against specific criteria, and meets the requirements of the syllabus. We are still in a Cartesian environment where the emphasis is on the individual; where recall is still important; and where content is provided in a ‘pre-digested’ format. There is a fear that through technology students will gain access to ‘raw’ content which may be inaccurate or defamatory, or it might go beyond the curriculum boundaries.  If we consider Seely Brown and Adler’s words then perhaps this is no longer as important since it is the discussion and debate that goes on around this content that makes meaning, not the content itself.  But how does that become operational in an education setting?   I have long argued that based on a social constructivist view of learning, which is the premise of ‘social learning’, students should be encouraged to work more collaboratively and be assessed, not only on their individual efforts, but on their collaborative work. After all, an effective work place often depends on team members working together to improve output and meet targets. <a href="http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/">The Partnership for 21st Century Skills</a> consortium in the US has produced some interesting designs for the future curriculum in schools that recognises, among others, the importance of collaboration. </font>

<font face="Arial">With the proliferation of web 2.0 tools anyone can create content, so why not students?  It is in the process of content creation where real learning takes place as students have to make choices about what is valid information, what is relevant and what to leave out. They have to agree a process whereby a consensus can be reached and decisions made about when the product of that collaboration is complete and publishable, and in what format(s) it should be published.  They have to agree on their audience; how to present them with their information; the format and suitability of that content; and whether and how they want others to interact with it. </font>

<font face="Arial">All this implies the acquisition of a new set of skills for teachers in order to provide the right level of support and intervention. After all, teachers are experts in their domain and as experts they have learnt how to operate within that domain; how to use certain skills and develop robust and effective techniques to solve problems; and how to further their knowledge and understanding. They need to be au fait with the tools that students use to create their content and to help their students to make choices about what resources to use and when; what to reject and why; how to extract the most valid, useful and relevant information and how to be critical and sceptical of information; how to mediate when groups disagree and how to support a group when they reach an impasse. Teachers also need to encourage students to seek and gain ideas and advice from experts inside and outside the school. And if the process of working and collaborating around content is what is important then teachers need to convene debriefing sessions where students discuss the processes they have gone through and the resulting output with each other and other groups. </font>

<font face="Arial">The tools available for collaboration are varied and which to use depend on whether the group are co-located or are in different regions, whether time differences vary and whether thinking time is required, as well as on cost and availability of the variety of tools. Both teachers and students need to be aware of the range of tools available and to make informed decisions about which to use and when. When is a wiki better than a bulletin board? When would a real time conversation serve the purpose better than an asynchronous discussion? Is an audio conference preferential to a video conference, and does it need to be recorded? Or would a text chat in real time be a more useful way of recording interactions. Do desktops need to be shared or can a document management system do a better job? When would you need to use both? When would telepresence really make sense? When would a virtual meeting through applications like webex be useful? As these tools proliferate, then teams have to select the most appropriate tools fit for purpose and be clear about how these tools will work be used to work together to make the collaboration seamless and meaningful. It is also important to remember there are times when working on your own is also important. This is time for consolidating your ideas and thoughts and your discussions with others, so blogs, mindmaps and journals are also an important part of the collaboration toolkit. </font>

<font face="Arial">Social learning is set to grow. Formal education needs to take grasp of it; not to appropriate it to do things in the same old way, but to move to a situation in which the boundaries between learning inside and outside school are blurred. In so doing perhaps school will no longer be seen by students as a necessary (or unnecessary) evil that has to be endured, but as an experience that has real relevance and value. </font>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Hi MIchelle,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and helped me shape my presentation (very timey :-)). Very interesting as I am sitting in a conference in Sophia Bulgaria where the debate is around curriculum reform and assessment. Tools of collaboration is what teachers are aware of but there is (as in many countries) a disconect from people at the MOE who plan the curriculum.  Again making the right choices when using technology in education  is a key queston for this conference. Most teachers agreed that teachers should be given "white spaces" in the curriculum (or students can call it "our spaces") to bring innovation, creativity etc

I have found this blog useful and have subscribed!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This was the title of a recent story in Canadian Government Executive magazine, a thoughtful publication generally focused on matters of importance to decision-making, non-elected, senior officials.  I've been thinking about it for some time because it touches on so many things, wittingly or otherwise.  The author is a well-respected individual, having spent time in government and as a public sector academic, has spent more than 30 years teaching Public Administration.

When I read <a href="http://networkedgovernment.ca/DoubtingThomas">his article "Are Networks the Wave of the Future"</a> the first time, I was tempted to put it into the dreaded "he doesn't get it" category...I say "dreaded" because not that many years ago, at the height of dotcom lunacy, whenever an online "business model" like say, selling furniture or groceries over the web was questioned, the response invariably was, "he/she doesn't get it"...makes me shudder recollecting the phrase.

Anyhow, I think the author's position reflects positions being taken by many senior leaders and advisors around the world and it may well be cautionary for reasons unintended.  While I personally would support his thinking, in terms of what I'd characterize as "empowering the centre" or "enabling the core" (concepts I've mentioned elsewhere on TCR as being central/essential in my opinion), there would seem to be kind of a suspended-animation feeling to this.  Some of his thinking gives me serious heartburn, especially a smug-sounding (to me) "we will survive" vibe.

The events and realities that surround governments threaten their relevance and utility and while caution may always be a good watchword, caution at the expense of action, only plays (or appears to play) into the hands of those with a vested interest.  I think more is known about networks in the public sector than is alluded to; the question is how is that knowledge being shared or institutionalized (or in this case, being delivered to leaders).

The author asks many questions and many are good ones, but they're questions without specific answers and if on the off-chance, they're meant as rhetorical, well then, given the level of discourse on the subject, I guess he doesn't you-know-what...]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>As you say, it is an interesting article and you can clearly see the academic who is sceptical of a fad. I can see why he might be annoyed by people who glibly say "its all about networks" without really meaning anything by it, but hopefully when we say it, we do actually mean something by it! I do also agree that even if there are many possibilities of radical change, some things will not change - power-broking by politicians, organising and co-ordinating by bureaucrats etc.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Paul Thomas is probably right when he says, "Bureaucracy is a persistent organizational form with legendary survival skills. Bureacracies will continue to be relied upon because they represent stability, controllability and predictability – attributes that allow for political direction and democratic accountability."

He is using 'network' in its broader, non-technology sense, which is fine, but even he will acknowledge, I am sure, that the persistence of bureaucracies in modern government is dependent upon the IP networks that now underpin the continued working of organizations everywhere. 

It will also be the case, I believe, that any government bureaucracy that does not enable networked working within and across the bureaucracy, will quickly find itself mired in inefficiency.

In my own sphere of education, bureacracy (in the technical, neutral sense that Max Weber and others intended) will continue to be the predominant mode of governance for large, formal systems of schooling - of that there is little doubt. But the network, in every sense, is playing a greater and greater role in those areas where education really matters - in the critical relationships between teachers and learners, between learners and learners, and between learners and the world in which they live and learn.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Actually, at one level he doesn't get it!  Maybe this is going to sound like reverse heresy and a bad case of too much Cisco-think, but when you trawl the work of people like David Weinberger and Yochai Benkler (The Wealth of Networks), someone is obviously way off here.  Now it may be that these folks are having themselves on and that Paul Thomas is right to sound a cautionary note.  Actually, I thought it was a great piece and very much in tune with people like Geoff Mulgan and Tom Bentley who spoke at the Nobel Summit session on Govt 2.0 (you can listen to the 5-minute audio casts at this link (http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le21/le34/nobel/2007/podcasts.html).  Their contributions especially were notable for their pragmatic caution and sense of balance about when networks and the social collaboration of Web 2 did and very much did not make sense. They argued, for example, that when difficult valiue trade-offs were to be made (the very stuff of politics, of course) then networks aren't much help.  Also, in the face of government's continuing compulsive embrace of surprise, silos and secreacy (the dreaded 3 S's!) it was unlikely that a wholesale dumping of some of the strengths of bureacuracy that Mr Thomas points out is going to happen any time soon.  But the real debate is whether you think this networking thing, and the current proliferation of social networking tools and capabilities, has a real impact on underlying structures of power, authority and accountability, on "agency" if you will.  If you think it does, then articles like this are dangerously complacentm even if they are wise and realistic in other respects.  if you think it doesn't, then Paul Thomas is safe and we can assume that the predictable and stable world of public administration with which he is (at least in part) right enamoured wil prevail.  On that test, I'm with the change makers and tend, for the moment, to feel more compelled bhy the likes of Weinberger and Benkler than with those whose apparent resistance could be mistaken for fear and intransigence masquerading as realism.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Times New Roman">Amory Lovins from the <a href="http://www.rmi.org/">Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)</a> </font><font face="Times New Roman">is undoubtedly one of the world’s foremost visionaries in energy efficiency, focusing on this critical theme long before anyone else. As far back as 1976 he published an article in Foreign Affairs suggesting that the end of the use of fossil fuels was inevitable. In fact, relatively recently Lovins returned to the topic and presented a roadmap whereby the US would cease to import oil by end of 2040 and would cease to use it altogether by 2050!</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Like all great visionaries, he was not recognized as such for a long time and was even regarded as an “alternative energy eccentric” in many influential circles. Today in contrast he and RMI are regarded as global thought leaders and advise CEOs from corporations of the likes of GM and Walmart and the Heads of State of many countries. At a relatively recent RMI celebration, Bill Clinton delivered an interesting <a href="http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid420.php">speech</a> </font><font face="Times New Roman">and </font><font face="Times New Roman">Thomas Friedman</font><font face="Times New Roman"> also <a href="http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid420.php">spoke</a>. </font><font face="Times New Roman">They each had very interesting remarks on the power of his thinking and the importance of RMI for the world at large. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Particularly interesting for all of us that follow Friedman’s synthesis of how the world operates and where is it going is that he is about to launch his new book with a strong focus on the “Green Revolution”. At the end of the meeting Lovins and Friedman had a <a href="http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid281.php">chat</a> about the “next 25 years” </font><font face="Times New Roman">and discussed the right balance between hope and fear to dream up and execute in a very large scale the solutions to energy efficiency and climate change that are required globally. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Lovins closing thought was that “public policies will play catch up to the forces of the markets” in innovation and in designing and executing the solutions – with laggard public policies needing to adapt to the change in motion. This is where I think a good debate can begin to develop as multiple energy market failures act as significant barriers, creating the need for proactive and systemic policy and economic frameworks that would overcome these failures and enable the innovation and the mass adoption of energy efficiency solutions. Today, even though about 50% of the global GHG abatement opportunity has to do with energy efficiency solutions that have a negative marginal cost (see the recent <a href="http://www.vattenfall.com/climatemap/">Vattenfall study</a>) and involve existing technologies they still have not been widely adopted. I will explore this so-called “energy-efficiency paradox” in the near future.</font>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In one of my recent forays onto (into?) the web I slipped down one of those odd little wormholes that take you places you've never seen before and found <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/4109"><font color="#0000ff">this article</font></a> challenging Metcalfe's law

Metcalfe's law, which states that <strong>the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users of the system (n²)</strong> requires no introduction around here - it is a fundamental axiom of the networking business. But here were the authors of this critique saying that it was wrong. Instead, they propose that <strong>the value of a network of size n grows in proportion to n log(n)</strong> i.e. more slowly than Metcalfe would have it. Radical stuff!

In their paper the authors present some interesting discussion of what creates the value of networks. Beyond just being a dry dissection of Metcalfe's logic, the paper has some worthwhile insights into the question of how to place an economic value on networks, and how to consider making investments in them.

However, this wasn't what really interested me. The essence of their argument against Metcalfe's law is that:
<blockquote><em>The fundamental flaw underlying both Metcalfe's and Reed's laws is in the assignment of equal value to all connections or all groups. The underlying problem with this assumption was pointed out a century and a half ago by Henry David Thoreau in relation to the very first large telecommunications network, then being built in the United States. In his famous book Walden (1854), he wrote: "We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate."</em></blockquote>
In pondering this my dystopian instincts were aroused and I was tempted to slip back into 'unreformed industrial age bureaucrat' mode.  Could this, I thought, be the proof on my own (and now never to be published) Craig's law, which was once to have stated that <strong>"the cost of doing business in the public sector rises, and the likelihood of reaching sensible conclusions decreases, in proportion to the square of the number of people involved"</strong>?  Connected Republic - bah humbug!!

However, that view simply doesn't stack up with my own experience in recent years, in which my capacity to perform effectively (I like to believe) as a public servant was (generally) vastly enhanced by operating in an increasingly networked environment.

So who do we rely upon - Metcalfe or his detractors? Fortunately, I didn't have to attempt a serious critique of 'n log(n)'. Metcalfe comes to his own defence in a nice piece called <font color="#0000ff"> </font><a href="http://vcmike.wordpress.com/2006/08/18/metcalfe-social-networks/"><font color="#0000ff">Metcalfe’s Law Recurses Down the Long Tail of Social Networking</font></a>. Here, among other things, he responds to his critics' assertion that Metcalfe's law is dangerous (because it can encourage irrational exuberance for investments in networks that become speculative bubbles a la the dotcom frenzy). He really came to my rescue with this statement:
<blockquote><em>But, if anybody wants to spend time on Metcalfe’s Law, let me suggest what are likely to be more fruitful paths. Accurate formulas for the static value of a network are fine, but it would be much more useful to understand the dynamics of network value over time. Also important would be linking Metcalfe’s Law to Moore’s Law and showing how that potent combination underlies what WIRED’s Editor-in-Chief Chris Anderson calls The Long Tail.</em></blockquote>
And it is at the point where I am about to disappear down the <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/"><font color="#0000ff">Long Tail</font></a> wormhole that I'll stop paraphrasing these various ideas and arguments and let others pursue them as they see fit.

So what to make of this? I concluded that, to me, it doesn't matter how much actual value we derive from networks. I'm just darned glad we've got them because of the capacity for social and economic value creation they give us.

My role has never been to put a value on networks. Instead, I have been (and remain) an advocate for them. I'm not so interested in the economics or mathematics of networks, but in their effects in the real world. And here I believe they are hugely positive - despite the extra burden they impose on old-school bureaucrats, and their facilitation of viruses and spam, and their hyper-enablment of many age old human foibles and failings etc.

In this day and age I just don't think we can prosper as individuals, communities, societies, economies or, most importantly, as a species without them. Take our global environmental problems. I think we'd be in our current situation regardless of whether we had networks or not.  But without networks our capacity to seperately and collectively understand and address our predicament would be vastly diminshed and the capacity for powerful vested interests (public and private) to game their responses would be much greater than it is.

Sunlight is, as they say, the best disinfectant. And that is what I think we get from networks - a heightened ability to see where we stand and where we need to get to. Thoreau was wrong -  we have many things of great importance to communicate, and we need to do it quickly. Of course communication and understanding is one thing and action is another, but I know what order I prefer to see them in.

 So Craig's law never was right and it turns out I'm one of the network utopians. That makes me happy. How about you?]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Russell, I like your point on economics of network. The qualitative change of ICT is often the most important and cannot be captured easily by nuimbers. My own motto (rather than a law :))  would be paraphrasing the management motto: if you can't measure it, you can't manage it: "if you can measure it, it doesn't matter"</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Reporting in from the first global conference for Connected Urban Development (CUD) in San Francisco.  The meeting has got off to a great start - hearing from the 3 CUD cities (Amsterdam, San Francisco and Seoul) and introduced to the 4 next CUD cities (Lisbon, Madrid, Birmingham and Hamburg).  Short note - we need to speed up the spread of CUD and CUD-like initiatives into Asia, which is after all where much of the largest, most urgent and spectacular urban action is going to be in the next 15 years!

Two big messages so far - sustainability is part of, and partly responsible for leading, a genuine market transition that in turn is fueling what we might call a "policy transition".  Embedding a sustainability ethic and mindset into the core policy processes of governments at all levels is what is really at stake.

The second message, hammered by Cisco CEO John Chambers in his impressive opening speech, is the need to move from a transactional to an architectural approach.  By which I take him to mean an approach that is integrated, systematic and designed, thinking about a response that is driven by, and makes sense within, a larger frame of policy outcomes and intended results.

Big shifts of thinking and vision are on the move, grounded in the equally powerful desire to see the grand ideas and urgent call for action grounded in practical projects that start delivering results now.  At the conference, we're going to see the "smart bus" solution to improve the reliability and convenience of public transport and the "personal transport assistant", which brings information about transport options to your mobile or PDA.

Great bunch of people here - Mayors, politicians, senior executives, think tanks, universities...and over 100 people turned away because we couldn't fit anyone else in!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're meeting in one of San Francisco's greenest buildings, the new Govt Services Administration Federal Government building.

 <img width="200" src="http://www.arup.com/_assets/_img/image420.jpg" alt="San Francisco Federal Building    © Morphosis" height="225" />

Quite a controversial design, but a fascinating building.  Built from recycled concrete and steel, no air conditioning (all done through clever use of windows and through-drafts).  Here's a link to more information via Arup, who built the building - <a href="http://www.arup.com/americas/project.cfm?pageid=1618">http://www.arup.com/americas/project.cfm?pageid=1618</a>

Couple of other big messages so far - shifting sustainability outcomes is fuelled by the fundamental change from the traditional role of cities, which allow people to move to information; now we can take information to people.  And success is going to be a combination of policy leadership, market-driven innovation and individual empowerment.  And all driven by new ways to access ideas, information and knowledge. ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The conference is over and, without doubt, Cisco and its city partners have landed a wonderful result.  Four new cities have joined (Lisbon, Madrid, Hamburg and Birmingham), the link has been forged between CUD's conceptual platform and the very real and practical 'things' that are now beginning to take shape - the fabulous 'connected bus', the Personal Travel Assistant, the new approach to smart work centres.  Basically, a real proof-of-concept meeting that has unleashed what I suspect is an unstoppable momentum for Cisco's central role in the global discussion about designing, building and living in sustainable cities.  Hugely exciting.

There is a forum, like this one, where you can go and get more information and the conference presentations - <a href="http://www.connecteddevelopment.org/">www.connectedurbandevelopment.org</a> - so go and have a look.

What really struck me about this conference was the powerful way in which it reinforced the transition of Cisco from a technology player to Cisco as a company whose technology capabilities are matched, and being clearly led, by a gathering intellectual and policy capacity.  It's that combination that is already so powerful.  The people in the room came from all points of the policy compass, so to speak - universities, city policy and technology leadership, national and regional government,  major writers and thinkers like Carlotta Perez (a barnstorming performance - the highlight of the two days for many, I'm sure) and Bill Mitchell from MIT.  All gathered together by Cisco, whose thinking and practical implementation has created a powerful, common frame of reference within which these players are working. 

In a way, I think that is CUD's most significant achievement - not so much the bus and the PTA and the cool applications (all of which are very important to give the whole thing some practical 'ballast' that real world leaders can see, touch and invest in!).  The most important thing about CUD is that it has become an idea, a common frame or platform on which a whole bunch of smart people can converge to think and act together.  The people who build that platform and then scale it are the ones who are really driving the progress in this cities debate - essentially an act of governance innovation and platform creation.  It is Cisco's natural territory and, over the two days in San Francisco, we showed its power and potential in full force. 

Very exciting, very satisfying and a wonderful result by the team - Nic Villa, Noni Allwood, Bas Boorsma, Wolfgang Wagener, Dave Evans, JD Stanley, Val Stoyanov, Jay Chung and Tony Kim, Carolyn Purcell and countless others who have chipped in over the last couple of years. 

And still so much to achieve, not the least (which is a task close to my heart) spreading the CUD 'virus' right into the heart of Asia, which will be the largest, most challenging and most exciting arena in which the ambition to create sustainable cities will be played out in the next 20 years...]]></content:encoded>

<title>The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Revisited</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was recently asked by one of my colleagues for my recommended reading list on the topic of “globalization”. A number of books immediately came to mind … books like the Bottom Billion by Paul Collier; The White Man’s Burden by William Easterly; The End of Poverty by Jeffrey Sachs; and The World is Flat by Thomas Friedman (a personal favourite). 

In the World is Flat, Friedman looks at the inter-connectedness of the modern world, and explores the implications of the changes brought on by huge improvements in ICTs. These technologies, he argues, have leveled the economic playing field around the world, making it more or less flat. Interestingly, some of the fastest growing economies in 2008 include Brazil, Russia, China, and India. 

But perhaps surprisingly, at the top of my recommended reading list is Friedman’s other book – The Lexus and the Olive Tree. Friedman’s 1999 best seller provides much of the intellectual foundation for The World is Flat and is, in my opinion, the better book. It provides an overall "big picture" look at globalization … although I find it to be a little light on the individual details.

What I liked best about this book (expanded and updated in 2002), which I’ve just finished re-reading, is that it is comprehensive in its thinking: it isn’t just about the integration of capital, the role of technology, or information - Friedman addresses how they all come together to transform the world.

He argues that globalization remains at the heart of a country's progress and prosperity. The basics of transparent governance, strong rule of law, and stable financial institutions continue to be the key components of a globalizing strategy.

In a nutshell, he argues that ICTs have made the world a smaller place – a place in which ideas and money can move almost instantly across borders. He argues that this new “globalization system” is profoundly influencing virtually every country in the world today, from Brazil to India. At the same time, there is significant tension between this new “globalization system” (the Lexus) and the ancient forces of culture, geography, tradition and community (the Olive Tree).

The resolution to this tension, according to Friedman, is to try and keep the Lexus and the Olive Tree in balance. Friedman highlights the challenge of developing countries to ‘glocalize' - to fit their societies, cultures and governments to the demands of a global marketplace, at a speed that suits them best. (An interesting concept, but one that I find he provides only minimal guidance on how to achieve).

<strong>But is he right?</strong> Well, not everyone agrees of course. While I agree that it isn’t as simple as Friedman portrays it – that any country can simply plug into the Internet, import knowledge and educate its people, and find shareholders from any other country to invest in its infrastructure - I do agree that a nation’s prosperity is now very much of its own choosing. Location, natural resources, etc. definitely help, but they are not decisive in terms of national prosperity. I believe a nation’s wealth has a lot to do with leadership and vision, how it chooses to organize and manage of the economy, the institutions they put in place, and the types of investments they choose to make.

The Lexus and the Olive Tree provides an interesting, “big picture” look at globalization – which I find particularly relevant to my current work with governments in emerging market countries. Regardless of what your ideological beliefs may be regarding globalization, or where you may think you fit into the overall global equation (my own situation is that I am a global resource, working for a global firm, and living in Canada - and I see globalization as a positive), Friedman shows us that we all have an undeniable stake in globalization. There's simply no escaping it.

<strong>One final thought:</strong> The question that continues to intrigue me is this – As more and more countries go down the globalization road, what will the world look like … a world with universal connectivity … in which we will all be able to be on-line all the time? What will government look like? What I would really like is for Friedman to revisit Lexus and the Olive Tree (again) in 2015 to see if his vision did in fact materialize.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>The opponents of globalisation tend to argue on two fronts - it doesn't work and it will end up making us all look the same.  

The evidence would suggest neither of those propositions is true.  It has always struck me that, as people legitimately enjoy the fruits of a flatter world, they are just as assiduous in their search for, and enjoyment of, what we might call the 'hyper local' dimensions of their lives.  Not only are te Lexus and the Olive Tree not opposites, they appear to be discovering some interesting and powerful ways not just to co-exist but to live in a relationshoip of mutual value and advantage.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I would much rather the discourse on Globalization came from economists like Joesph Stiglitz (Nobel winner for economics and was Chief Economist at World Bank), Paul Krugman (Princeton), Pankaj Ghemawat (Harvard)etc. Ted Koppel interviews Friedman and Joseph Stiglitz, who ofcourse doesnt find a mention in Friedman's book.
http://select.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/opinion/25friedman-transcript.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin

Two books to read, which offer a counterperspective to Friedman's "The World is Flat."

The Harvard Professor, Pankaj Ghemawat's latest book, "Redefining Global Strategy," is more academically inclined. I read an article of his published in the journal, "Foreign Policy", where he argues that the world is, at best, only semi-globalized.  His argument being that Cultural, Administrative, Geographic and Economic aspects of a nation come in the way of total globalization from taking place and cites examples of the same.

The other small, but interesting book, is by Aronica and Ramdoo, "The World is Flat? A Critical Analysis of Thomas Friedman's New York Times Bestseller." It is a small book compared to the 600 page tome by Friedman, and aimed at the common man and students alike. As popular as the book may be, some reviewers assert that by what it leaves out, Friedman's book is dangerous. The authors point to the fact that there isn't a single table or data footnote in Friedman's entire book. "Globalization is the greatest reorganization of the world since the Industrial Revolution," says Aronica. Aronica and Ramdoo conclude by listing over twenty action items that point the way forward, and they provide a comprehensive, yet concise, framework for understanding the critical issues of globalization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A system is characterized by a network of – equal or different – parts and their organization. The more complex a system is, the more dynamic, chaotic, intense and manifold are its interactions with and between its parts and the higher is its capability to organize itself.

Traditional administrations are systems with narrow focus and low permeability oriented to reduce complexity. They are efficient in solving basic issues effectively. On the other hand, in hierarchal, rigid structures complex problems have the tendency to grow or, worse, not to be addressed at all. Traditional top-down governance models neutralize the lateral self-organization, moderation and acceleration capabilities of networked systems and therefore address complexity inadequately.

In the connected age, governance structures define themselves by the complexity of the connected system itself. Therefore, connected government rather “flows” around and through problems and it embeds them as part of the solution: Transformation and integration instead of resolution and elimination.

The Roman Empire could only flourish for centuries because of its true symbiosis with and integration of the cultures around the Mediterranean, instead of their elimination. The model can stand for the connected global republic: its golden age has just begun.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Peter - a very insightful way of putting it. It would be interesting to hear your account of how this works in practice - what in your view are good examples of connected government in practice?</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[My colleague Alan Balutis and a group of Washington experts have been doing some fascinating thinking about the next (44th) U.S. President's Management Agenda ("PMA 44"). There are a wealth of insights in their <a href="http://www.thepublicmanager.org/articles/issueTOC.aspx" target="_blank">Public Manager Articles</a>, but a couple of different aspects really struck home with me. The first was the HR issues. The U.S. - like many developed countries - faces a retirement tsunami that will hit the public sector particularly hard. As well as the potential loss of expertise, this raises a major recruitment issue, particularly since the public sector is somehow going to have to attract a Web 2.0 generation of new employees. This will be a challenge, but the upside is that it may have a major positive impact in encouraging government to embrace Web 2.0 tools and more importantly Web 2.0 approaches.

More generally, though, how is the public sector going to attract the brightest and the best? Thankfully, the appeal of public service is never going to go away, but I do think we are going to have to come up with a new deal for public servants if we want to make the public sector a place people really want to work in. Part of this is about the rewards package, but for me it is also about ensuring that there are plenty of opportunities for non-elected officials to achieve the satisfaction of really making a difference. We need great leadership in the political sphere, but we also need appropriate career paths and appropriate challenges for non-elected public servants.

The other issue that struck me in the articles was the search for a big idea. How do we make the task of public sector transformation interesting for politicians and for the public? What is the right banner or slogan to ignite a new wave of reform? Labels (such as our old friend "e-government") may be simplistic and misleading, and they certainly get tired, but if the 44th U.S. President is going to drive forward a radical management agenda he (or she!) will need a better and clearer big idea than any that have yet surfaced in the two main parties' nomination campaigns.

Discussion on the PMA 44 will hopefully continue and intensify in the coming months and I know my US colleagues will be shaping and enlivening the debate. There have already been quite a few posts on this in the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/forums/">Forums</a>, so do feel free to make your contribution to the discussion either by commenting on this blog or by posting in the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=16&amp;sid=0d67b90c448ee07ab15e5312ec89993b" target="_blank">PMA 44 Forum</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>In reading your comments about the problems in attracting young and talented workers to government, I couldn't help but recall the Washington Monthly article "Finding the Civil Service's Hidden Sex Appeal" (http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_11_32/ai_66922112). Although the article was published in 2000, most of its points are still relevant today – that is, young workers don’t leave government because of low pay or uninteresting work; they leave because of an inflexible work environment that is not personally rewarding. Young workers want challenging work in which they have the room to excel and can advance on their merits. For now, the federal bureaucracy rarely offers that.

As to the point that government needs to embrace Web 2.0 applications to attract younger workers (a good example is given in "The Future Workforce" article in The Public Manager, which you mention, about a young worker disillusioned that she cannot use IM in the workplace), I suggest reading Government Executive's "Shadow IT," (http://www.govexec.com/features/1007-01/1007-01admt.htm), in which the writer argues that it is futile for agencies to resist the new technologies because Web 2.0 is an integral part of life for "digital natives." Federal managers need to manage it, not fight a losing battle, and in the interim turn young workers off to public service.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Allowing younger workers to use the networking technologies that they know and use routinely in their private lives is important.  I would submit that it is even more important to allow and encourage these young workers unleash their creativity to find ways that they can engage citizens with the work of their agencies using these new social networking tools.  Government can be a change agent in building and supporting communities and encouraging their civic engagement.  Opening a technology door for quick and easy dialogue between citizens and their government and among citizens themselves can change the face of government institutions that often look to the public like an impersonal, monumental and never-changing mable edifices.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Allan and Fred correctly identify some of the challenges facing public sector entities when recruiting new workers.  In addition to the issues they raise, I suggest the need to examine the context and meaning of "public sector," as it has grown substantially in the past ten years to include not-for-profits and NGOs.  In fact, many graduate programs in public administration find that over half of their MPA graduates now go to these latter organizations rather than traditional government agencies.  Why?  It generally is not the salary and benefits, as they often barely match progressive government agencies.  More likely it is because they not only offer the opportunities and experiences that Allan and Fred suggest are essential, it is also because they are smaller, more flexible, and less stove-piped.  As a result, younger workers can find audiences for their creative ideas, interact more easily with a wider range of individuals, and gain much broader experience.  Can government agencies do this?  Some do.  In fact, for many professions the federal government can offer greater challenges and responsibilities for younger workers than the private sector (attorneys is a profession that comes to mind).  But when agencies remain stove-piped, or embrace succeeding layers of review and oversight, it becomes even more difficult for creativity to flourish.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Steve has hit it right on the head - a growing proportion of public policy work is not being done, or at least not being led or predominantly led, by the public sector.  Many of the large endeavours on which our societies are embarked - reducing the impact and cost of global warming, lifting literacy, eradicating poverty, renewing the value and impact of public education and so on - are going to be dealt with by the decisions, expertise and resources of people and organisations outside of government.  That is not, in itself, a new phenomenon.  But the scale and intensity of the problems we're grappling with have exacerbated the problem and brought the limits of the public sector into stark relief.

So what we are encountering is the rise of something we might describe as a "public purpose" sector, not a formal new institutional structure in itself but rather a label we might give to the new coalitions of influence and expertise who are now on the public policy frontline.  The label is not new either - I first came across it in a book by US writer Lisbeth Schorr, writing about US social policy.  

What is really interesting is what happens to the public sector itself in the face of these developments?  In the world of self-directed services and the kind of radical user-focused service models that Leadbeater and friends are describing, what exactly is the job of the public sector?  How should it be organised?  What tools and capabilities does it need?  How does it apply regimes of accountability appropriate to this new networked, virtual model?  

I don't think we have much idea about what the answers to these kinds of questions might be.  In the old world, it was reasonably straight forward.  We expected the public sector to "design, direct and deliver".  Now we expect it to orchestrate processes and players engaged in much the same work but with orders of magnitude more complexity.  

For many people, as the comments in this thread have already noted, for those still burning with the public policy fire, often the best place to pursue thier passion is not in government at all. Maybe that's not such a bad thing.  Maybe instead of lamenting the erosion of the traditional public sector we should be celebrating the rise and rise of the "public purpose" sector and its promise of new energy, insight and creativity?</wp:comment_content>

<title>The Case for Self-Directed Services</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[A little while back I blogged (slightly sceptically) on the idea of giving budgets to service users so they can directly shape the services they receive.  Via the  new <a href="http://www.socialinnovationexchange.org/" target="_blank">SIX site</a> I have  just come across a very <a href="http://www.socialinnovationexchange.org/node/401" target="_blank">persuasive pamphlet</a> by Charlie Leadbetter, J. Bartlett and N. Gallagher using the evidence of UK pilots in this area to make a very convincing case for what they call "self-directed services". They identify six components of this approach:
	<li>a personalised support plan that reflects an individual's ambitions based on an early indication of the budget available;</li>
	<li>access to sources of support and advice to help draw up the plan;</li>
	<li>a personal budget devolved to them with as few restrictions as possible;</li>
	<li>the ability to mix formal and informal services and support in the community;</li>
	<li>new measures of success which show how person-centric measures of quality of life outcomes contribute to overall public policy goals;</li>
	<li>light-touch oversight by the local authority to ensure that money is well spent, fraud is rooted out and risks are well managed.</li>
The argument that particularly struck me was the cultural impact this approach can have. In particular, the shift away from passivity. Rather than being a recipient, the budget-holder is the person taking the lead in improving their own situation. The relationship with professionals also changes as their advisory role increases (and their control and management role decreases). Furthermore, a new range of informal players (family, friends etc) can now be involved both in advice giving but also to some extent in service delivery. Rather than starting with professional assessment of the individual's needs, the starting point is self-assessment. As one user put it, "when I was asked, "what is important in your life" I was suddenly struck. No one had asked me that before, and it suddenly gave me a new perspective on where I wanted to be".

It's not hard to see how this approach can work well for those empowered with devolved budgets, but the pamphlet also explores the benefits for the public sector. Here unfortunately the cost issue is likely to play an important role, since this approach is only ever likely to be rolled out to large numbers of service users if the business case makes sense. So can this approach make financial sense? How can it save money as well as improving the satisfaction of users? Clearly, the cultural change I have already referred to can have a significant beneficial impact insofar as active, empowered and happier service users are over time likely to require less support. Furthermore, the ability to tailor their services to their individual needs on a day-to-day basis can eliminate a lot of waste - allocated services that are reluctantly consumed or booked but not taken up at all. Interestingly, data from pilots in the UK where 102 people were moved from traditional care plans onto personal budgets, shows the average cost of care package falling by about 10 per cent. The pamphlet also mentions the Western Australian Local Area Coordinator programme where client costs are apparently 35 per cent lower than the national average.  So it is possible that the business case may add up, although one needs to be careful of "pilot programme" syndrone where the natural enthusiasm of those undertaking the pilot distorts the results or leaves some costs forgotten or under-reported. There is also the dreaded issue of transition, since the authors recognise that many traditional services (such as residential and day care centres) would be likely to see a significant drop in demand if there was a widespread move to self-directed personal services.

So far this approach has mainly been used very specific types of social care recipients (typically people with complex long term needs e.g. young adults with learning disabilities), but the pamphlet suggests it could be extended in all sorts of directions such as personal budgets for maternity services, for job search and employment, for drug user and offender rehabilitation, for young people not in education, employment or training, for people with mental health problems and for supporting families at risk. I found this list really interesting - I particularly liked the maternity services suggestion where it does seem to me that there is a largely one-size-suits-all programme that people are given whereas they could probably devise more appropriate (and potentially less resource intensive) alternatives for themselves. So I do think there is great potential here and in a wide range of areas. I think the key to speeding up widespread piloting and take-up will be the issue of showing that this approach at worst costs no more than traditional approaches and I suspect this is an area where more work and analysis is still needed. It would be great, however, to see pilots in some of the new areas the authors highlight.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The biggest single obstacle to the wider and more rapid uptake of online services and capabilities, in the private as well as the public sector, is trust or rather the lack of it.

All of the evidence seems to reinforce that what holds people back from a more full-blooded embrace of the online world is whether it is 'safe to play'.  Will my privacy be respected?  How will my information be treated and how can i be sure noone is going to mieuse it for purposes I didn't agree to when it was legitimately collected? On the sure-fire understanding that something does go wrong, how easy it for me to get proper redress and perhaps even compensation in some situations?

All of these simple, pratical and profoundly difficult questions are the focus of a short whitepaper we've published, called "Safe to Play".  You can download it here - ht<a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/downloads/">tp://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/downloads/</a>.

It's only short and is wide open for comment and feedback. (In fact, feel free to comment on the document on our <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/wiki/Safe_to_Play" target="_blank">new wiki facility</a> if you want). One of its central propositions is that the network itself is in many situations a central part of the response to the problems that a more connected, and often uncomfortably transparent world, has generated.

It's an intriguing conundrum to contemplate that the cause of the problem might be the source of the solution.  Or at least the source of an important part of the solution.

See what you think and let us know.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know it’s dangerous to get too misty-eyed about the corrosive and liberating potential of the blogosphere, but stories like this can’t help make you feel a little more optimistic.  Maybe I’m just kidding myself…but for the moment, I’m going to take this as another important straw in the wind that tells us something good about the renovation of the democratic conversation.

Here is how the Economist told <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displayStory.cfm?story_id=10854822&amp;amp;subjectID=348963&amp;amp;fsrc=nwl" target="_blank">the story</a>:

<strong>The government's cyber-enthusiasm comes back to haunt it</strong>

ON MARCH 8th Malaysia's electoral upset unfolded at glacial pace on government-owned television channels. As the approved pundits stumbled to grasp the stunning implications, some 500,000 Malaysians lost patience, and turned to Malaysiakini, an independent online newspaper, with 35 staff. It was faster and did not fight shy of trumpeting the opposition's excellent showing.

Even before election night, the internet had already played a big part in the vote. Malaysia has an unusual combination of high internet penetration and pliant mainstream media. It is therefore fertile ground for cyber-politics. According to the government's multimedia regulator, 3.9m of the country's 28m people have dial-up internet subscriptions and 1.2m broadband. Some 60% of the population, it reckons, use the internet. Even if that is an overestimate, the limitations of the mainstream media are enough to drive politics online.

Television hardly ever covers opposition rallies and speeches. But the online world is delightfully free. Anxious to make Malaysia a high-tech cyber-hub, the county's former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, exempted websites from the annual licensing requirements that help keep print publications deferential. The 1998 Communications and Multimedia Act decreed that there would be no censorship of the internet.

That does not, of course, make it a free-for-all. Strict laws—on defamation, for example—still apply. But the air of the blogosphere is refreshing after the stultifying fug of Malaysia's mainstream press. Jeff Ooi (www.jeffooi.com) and Tony Pua (tonypua.blogspot.com) were among several successful opposition candidates to have made their names as bloggers. Mr Pua thinks all parties underestimated the effects of “secondary access” to the internet, as news broken on the web—of opposition rallies, for example—was disseminated by word-of-mouth and mobile-phone text messages.

Most worrying for the government and the mainstream media, Malaysia is young. A new generation sees the internet as its primary news source. Founded in 1999 as a free site, Malaysiakini was forced to start charging in 2002, but was free for the election. In normal times, it has just 10,000 subscribers. But the election has been a great advertisement for it, as well as for democracy.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>This is what my friend and Cisco colleague James Yong remarked in his brief response to my comments on this article (James is a Malaysian who has lived in Singapore for a long time and the author of one of the best books on eGovernment in Asia):

James' response:

"I tend to agree with Martin's view. As a Malaysian (even though I haven't lived in Malaysia for some time) I remain very interested in the politics. I followed the campaigning process through Malaysiakini and other blog sites (another good one is Malaysia Today www.malaysia-today.net ) . What appeared in the newspapers and TV paled in comparison with what one could see on these sites, especially videoclips of fiery speeches by opposition leaders like Anwar Ibrahim (the former DPM who was jailed by former PM Dr Mahathir), no holds barred articles criticising the activities of various parties &amp; politicians, and tons of citizen feedback. I think we all knew before polling day that the National Front's decline was going to be quite significant.
 
On polling night itself, like a huge number of Malaysians, I stayed up very late, switching my attention between TV and the Malaysiakini website. It was soon clear that the official TV channels were slow in announcing results. In fact after a while, even the TV journalists started referring to Malaysiakini instead of waiting for the polling station officials to declare the final results. The Malaysiakini site went down around 2am through overwhelming traffic, but by then the overall trend was clear with several states falling to the opposition. The usually graphics-heavy site was quickly replaced by a more spartan version (no graphics) for the next few days, so that Netizens could continue to follow the happenings.
 
The blogosphere and I guess web 2.0 in general is going to have a huge impact on governments, whether they like it or not. Governments in these part of the world, who are used to traditional media (TV, radio, newspapers) they can easily control, have found themselves struggling with this new channel of information distribution &amp; the online community that quickly develops around it."</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>It gets more interesting...this piece suggests that the blogosphere has infiltrated the heart of the democratic process (the parliament), which should make for some interesting times ahead in Malaysian politics:

Here's a short report from the India press:

"Malaysia’s political landscape was hit hard from cyberspace last week when a blogger entered Parliament after winning in elections that saw the ruling coalition lose its two-thirds majority in the House.

In a country where the mainstream media largely supported the government, Jeff Ooi — a former advertising copywriter — used his political blog to win a seat on an Opposition ticket. He was not the only blogger in the fray. 

Elizabeth Wong, a social activist and blogger, won a state assembly election. Badrul Hisham Shahrin, who ran for Parliament, lost to Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi’s son-in-law after four recounts. He was contesting from a rural area where not many could read his blogs.

The southeast Asian country is still reeling under the latest political shock, after the Internet played a key role in shaping political thought and generated an anti-government wave days before millions set out to vote.

Technology destroyed the powerful hold that Abdullah’s Barisan Nasional had over Malaysia, where sex scandals and videos of ministers frolicking with  their girlfriends have been posted on YouTube, much to their embarrassment.

Technology is becoming a huge part of campaigns. In the Philippines, SMS bursts can bring tens of thousands of people to the streets. And the Malaysian elections show that in countries where the media are controlled, people and the Opposition now have an alternative where they can campaign, discuss and collect money for their cause. In several countries across Asia, the Internet has politically empowered people, a phenomenon that is only going to spread as the cyberspace expands.

So when Ooi (www.jeffooi.com) went on his walkabouts while campaigning, all he heard was a call for change. He told an online magazine that eye contact with potential voters helped online donations for his campaign. On her blog (elizabethwong.wordpress.com), Wong spoke of a new dawn in her state, Selangor. “We need your help and inputs. We need honest, committed residents to fill in the blanks and vacancies… We have to deliver,” she wrote 
after winning the assembly seat."

<wp:comment_content>And just to tail off the whole story, talk about 'from the horses mouth'!  Here, in a short piece from AFP, Malaysian PM Badawi provides possible the most powerful possible endorsement of the power of the revolution that almost cost him government...

Thanks to my colleague James Yong for drawing this to my attention...

"Agence France-Presse 
 
Posted date: March 25, 2008
 

KUALA LUMPUR--Malaysia's premier Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday his "biggest mistake" in disastrous elections was to ignore cyber-campaigning on the Internet which was seized by the opposition. 
The powerful Barisan Nasional coalition suffered its worst-ever results in March 8 polls that left five states and a third of parliamentary seats in opposition hands.

The opposition, which was largely ignored by government-linked mainstream media, instead waged an enormously successful online campaign using blogs, news websites and SMS text messages.

"We certainly lost the Internet war, the cyber-war," Abdullah said in in a speech to an investment conference.

"It was a serious misjudgement. We made the biggest mistake in thinking that it was not important," he said.

"We thought that the newspapers, the print media, the television was supposed to be important, but the young people were looking at SMS and blogs."

The comments are a major about-face for the government, which had vilified bloggers, calling them liars and threatening them with detention without trial under draconian internal security laws.

In line with promises to reform after the humiliating election results, Abdullah said the government would "respond effectively" and move to empower young Malaysians.

"It was painful ... but it came at the right time, not too late," he said.

Malaysia's mainstream media are mostly part-owned by parties in the ruling coalition, and what was seen as biased coverage in the run-up to last month's vote alienated voters and boosted demand for alternative news sources.

Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranks Malaysia 124 out of 169 on its worldwide press freedom index. It says mainstream media are "often compelled to ignore or to play down" opposition events."</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been fortunate in the past couple of months to enjoy a double dose of David Weinberger.  At the Nobel Public Services Summit in Stockholm and at the recent Cisco meeting in Orlando, the author of The Cluetrain Manifesto and more recently "Everything is Miscellaneous" shared his views about the possibilities and pitfalls of the social web.

My big interest in David's thesis of the semantic web is the impact on public policy and public management, of course.  It strikes me we are witnessing a titanic struggle over power, control and authority between those currently camped on the commanding heights of public policy and those who are busily undermining them with the new capabilities of what we might describe as radical collaboration.  

Now I have plenty of friends and contacts, many of them very senior in the political and bureaucratic worlds, who accuse me of terminal romanticism and who reassure me, somewhat patronisingly I think at times, that “these things too will pass” and their world will chug on, largely unaffected except perhaps at the margin…a nice website here, a fun blog there.  

Whether or not I am too romantic or hopeful or whether or not their complacency is warranted, there is one dimension of this debate that we don't talk about enough, and that is accountability.  The old world of politics has erected a very convoluted scaffold of checks and balances to keep the people who have the power more or less accountable to the people on whose behalf they are meant to be exercising it.  The new world of the ‘semantic web’ and social networking seems to be busy dismantling much of that scaffold, or at least posing some pretty tough questions about its continuing relevance and usefulness.  

While some will use this anxiety about accountability as a smokescreen for their inertia or outright hostility to the whole idea of the new participative web and its democratic potential, it is true I think that failure to explain how you hold people properly accountable, in a world in which mash-up collaborations of increasingly complex varieties are creating outcomes and opportunities (and inevitably on occasions some mistakes as well) is a barrier to a more rapid and widespread embrace of these new capabilities by the public policy/management process.

The nice thing about hierarchies is that, by and large, you know who to blame when things go wrong.  You know who to sack, discipline or vote out of office.  In the wonderful world of radical collaboration, these neat black lines get smudged and it's pretty hard to figure out quite who is in charge and who gets to be responsible for what happens.  Until we work out an accountability regime that works in this new environment, we're going to make slower progress than we might hope.      ]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Martin, great point. But why exactly do the public policy/management types want accountability? Because that's the way the world has always worked? Because it is a moral requirement? Or for pragmatic reasons? 

I ask because one could argue -- in fact, I would argue -- that much of the amazing progress we've made in the new connected world has been due to a relaxing of the requirement that participants be accountable. There's a huge cost to making systems highly accountable -- and not just a monetary cost. So, we have allowed systems to create their own types of accountability, usually minimally addressing specific needs; eBay has one set of needs and one type of accountability while Amazon reviews have a different sort, etc. 

So, I'd like to know what practical problems the policy/mgt folks need to address and whether accountability is the best way to address them. undoubtedly, sometimes it will. But, highly likely, many times it won't be.

I think.

<wp:comment_content>It's a useful question to ask why we need accountablity and what it is supposed to achieve.  I suspect much of the accountability scaffolding with which public policy is encumbered has lost sight of the reasons it was erected in the first place.  A bit of 'zero-based budgeting' aimed at a fundamental review of acountability structures wouldn't go astray.

But your point, David, is an important one.  What is accountability meant to achieve?  I think in the public policy realm there are two main outcomes.  One is to know whether or not the intended results of a policy intervention or action have been achieved and, if not, why.  That allows us to make sensible decisions, in theory, about whether or not we want to persist with that action, change it or stop it.

The second outcome is deeper and more pervasive.  The accountability mechanisms we want are there to keep those with power in the system answerable for their actions.  In that sense, accountabiity is the indispensable tool of any half-way respectable democratic system, giving us some tools and levers we can use to find out if the people with all the power are wielding it in ways we approve.  And, if they are not, we need to be able to get rid of them and put someone else in charge.

I was struck by your other comment, that the world of radical collaboration in the connected world was evolving only by somehow discounting the level and complextiy of accountability with which it was surrounded.  Building something this complex, you seem to be suggesting, needs to have a kind of "accountability holiday" to give people the room to play, to experiment, to innovate and to take risks.  Is that the point?

I"m drawn by that idea and also partly worried by it.  Seems to me we can't accept any diminution of accountability when it comes to the world of public policy and management because, at base, it's all about power.  And the one thing we know about power is that it will be misused if it is not held to account. Actually, we also know it gets misued even if we DO hold it to account, but that's a whole other story!

What interests me is the question of whether we need to be inventing new forms of accountability to suit the connected world.  Like the eBay example you raise (and I know the risks of that example, but it's still a good one), maybe we need to discover how the network itself, which enabled this dense, complex conectedness and consequent transparency, is itself one of the best hopes we have of keeping this new world not just accountable in the old terms, but in some ways even more acocuntable than before.

So my challange is to embark on some systematic search for new ways to harness the very tools and capabilities that the conncted world is inventing to (a) craft new accountability methods and processes and (b) create those tools in ways that do not, as you suggest in your comment, get in the way of the kind of serial risk-taking and 'play' that is the engine of discovery in this new world in the first place.

Maybe the key is the idea, inherent in your comment, that we might need to discover different types of levels of accountability for different purposes.  An accountability regime that is more nuanced and subtle wouldbn't be a bad outcome to aim for, as well as being 'fit for purpose'.

Does that make sense?</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Brilliant. 

I think the lesson of the Net is not that accountability is bad but that it needs to be more supple, more accountable (so to speak) to the goals it's trying to achieve and the organizational structure that can best achieve those goals. 

Systems do tend to grow static, at which point accountability can get mixed up with other social aims that may not advance the actual agenda, namely, accountability gets mixed up with power for its own sake. As you point out, this is particularly a danger in the world of public policy.

We don't yet know whether the Net culture (as if that word could ever really be singular!) is going to reify into patterns of authority that get in the way of innovation and the achievement of social ends. Maybe. But reinventing accountability might be one way to work against that reification.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[More evidence from the front line of the world of online politics that tests our views about whether we are witnessing the birth of a genuine, disruptive transformation of the way we play the game of politics and government, or whether we are witnessing nothing of the sort.This is how PoliticsOnline reported the phenomenon of Barack Obama's 'Wright' speech which was posted on YouTube:

"Barack Obama's 37 minute-long speech has skyrocketed to the 51st most viewed video of all time on YouTube. Only three days after addressing the Nation in what is now a historical speech on race in America, Obama's "A More Perfect Union" speech has already been viewed 2,761,832 times, with 5,640 comments and favorited 9,889 times. These statistics do not take into account the number of times the video has been duplicated and watched on other sites, including<font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> <a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001PZ_BiG-2HSgLjNZ_U-Vn8aWjdDpWNXfeNrbelyvYnQDnTKnNvvNVLlEwrulQiA4K5HLiOvJ9r0ovgZ-klzR_PWedOI1l0NISdqa7iLjiAhxZkSDLt1U9OoJ5PZL3dbvpuB6TjjsfJ1uL0d7OJbj27A==" title="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001PZ_BiG-2HSgLjNZ_U-Vn8aWjdDpWNXfeNrbelyvYnQDnTKnNvvNVLlEwrulQiA4K5HLiOvJ9r0ovgZ-klzR_PWedOI1l0NISdqa7iLjiAhxZkSDLt1U9OoJ5PZL3dbvpuB6TjjsfJ1uL0d7OJbj27A== blocked::http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001PZ_BiG-2HSgLjNZ_U-Vn8aWjdDpWNXfeNrbelyvYnQDnTKnNvvNVLlEwrulQiA4K5HLiOvJ9r0ovgZ-klzR_PWedOI1l0NISdqa7iLjiAhxZkSDLt1U9OoJ5PZL3dbvpuB6TjjsfJ1uL0d7OJbj27A==">Obama's website</a>.</font>

Obama's speech has been the number 1 most viewed viral video on the Net for the past three days. Keep in mind that YouTube only counts a video as 'viewed' if it is watched in its entirety. The fact that Sen. Obama was able to keep the interest of online viewers for 37 minutes is historical in its own right. Not only are people watching the video, they are blogging about it. Sen. Obama has 54% of the Internet's 'political buzz', and has been mentioned in 976 blogposts in the past 24 hours."</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> </font><font color="#303030" face="RotisSemiSansLight" size="2"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWe7wTVbLU" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWe7wTVbLU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWe7wTVbLU</a></font>

Surely this is adding up to more than just ‘enabling' an otherwise unchanged political and democratic process? Isn't it something more than ‘enabling' when almost 3 million people are watching a half hour political speech and then tagging it, blogging it, discussing it (nearly 6000 comments alone). There is an intensity and a level of interaction and dialogue, surely, that simply isn't possible in the world of Politics 1.0.

The YouTube piece is a feed from CNN. Is the nature of the experience of watching the speech on CNN and watching it on YouTube qualitatively different? Is this just the battle of the channels or the beginning of a whole new way to engage with politics in the first place? Does the community dialogue that the YouTube experience spawned make this a different type of experience, a more intense and involved process? What does it mean that almost 3million people watch a political speech? Does it mean anything? Does it portend something new, powerful and full of promise in the renewal of the democratic conversation, or does it not? Are the cynics and hard heads right to discount the numbers and the clever technology and see in this nothing more than an amplification of certain aspects of a fundamentally unchanged endeavour? Are we witnessing a phenomenon in which something that looks and feels so astonishing adds up in the end to nothing much at all?If it is truly different, we need to be able to define exactly how. What features of the political process are being disrupted and, more importantly, what is the hard evidence to suggest not just that lots of people are watching a YouTube clip but that their engagement with this content is part of a qualitatively different way of 'doing' politics. I suspect the cynics and doubters are still waiting to see what that evidence is and how compelling it might be.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Networking Democracy - Can National Conversations Work?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning I came across a great UK experiment in online democracy - <a href="http://ourkingdom.opendemocracy.net/2008/03/24/networking-democracy/" target="_blank">Networking Democracy</a>, an OpenDemocracy project to explore how the internet can be integrated into a national political process. The idea arose from Gordon Brown's decision to launch a national debate on a British Statement of Values as part of his plans to reform the Governance of Britain. So the government wants to get people involved in a debate on these issues and is considering having various regional events and other debates culminating in a people's summit. It has an <a href="http://governance.justice.gov.uk/" target="_blank">interesting but non-consultative site</a> to help people keep up with the debate, but does not really seem to have planned for any kind of systematic online discussion. So OpenDemocracy have risen to the challenge and started a conversation on whether the internet can help democracy work better.

They began by getting four experts to start their discussion with their views on this issue and then invited a select group to a conversation around these starting points. Now they have moved into phase two where the outcome of that conversation is aggregated and the wider world is invited to participate. In one of "expert" posts Tony Curzon Price <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/networking-democracy/national-conversation-conversation" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that a conversation involves listening - typically, the force of this comment would be the government, but interestingly I do not think that is what Tony primarily had in mind. Actually all the participants in a conversation are supposed to listen: so it is not just the government that has the challenge of listening to 55 million people - you and I face it too if we genuinely want to participate in a national conversation! (Illustration: I am really interested in the networking democracy conversation and have spent a fair amount of time reading the many contributions to the debate, but I certainly have not read them all! and even if I pique your interest in the conversation I doubt whether you will either).  This point leads Tony towards the idea of deliberative citizen panels or virtual conversations that qualify you to be part of a deliberative citizen panel.  Stephen Clift suggests a more online approach with<a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/networking-democracy/online-engagement-in-a-national-debate" target="_blank"> his three-pronged strategy</a> of: a) a distributed online survey with comment submission and rating to hit a mass audience; b) networked engagement through multiple partners (such as NGOs) with part of the audience generated by a); and c) Online Deliberative Participation in a more intense way with a smaller group somehow selected from b).

So where does all this get us? For me you need to start with a clear idea as to the point of this activity - why do we want a conversation and what good will it do? Clearly part of the idea is to overcome the apparent gulf between political elites and the people, but I think whatever you do needs to link into our current system of representative democracy rather than try to short circuit it.  It is also clearly wrong to think that any conversation however brilliantly managed is going to generate consensus. So I do not think online conversation is going to deliver a perfect set of answers. Rather much of the value has to lie in the process itself. This is most obvious at the local level where an online discussion about litter in my local park can help me build relationships with my neighbours and that can then lead to us as a group getting more involved in how things are decided in our area.

So online discussion is about helping people to find each other and encouraging them to engage more with public issues (and existing democratic processes). Nationally, I also think it should play a role in enriching and shaping the debate. One of the advantages of online discussion is that it can generate a mass of perspectives and ideas, so we should use Web 2.0 tools (comments, vods, ratings) to generate new ideas to feed into the political process. And we should use deliberative citizen panels to get deeper insights into what people really believe. But in both cases I do not think the outputs should trump democracy - they need to be structured so as to have a high chance of having an impact but I do not think it makes sense to suggest that either approach would have a direct decision-making role. (To avoid confusion - I am not arguing for the status quo in relation to our democratic institutions - I certainly think they should all be exploring lots of new ways of pulling us citizens into their debates or rather bringing their debates to us but ultimately most of the tough decisions (and most decisions are tough) will have to be made via representative institutions - open, transparent, engaged and accountable institutions but still institutions that decide).

For example, I would be in favour of a mixed online and offline debate to generate the best and most popular ideas on how we can celebrate and reinforce the values of our society; if the debate got traction and generated some good ideas, presumably the government will want to take at least some of them forward or the opposition (or media) can champion then and force the government to adopt them. Similarly, I think online discussions and deliberate panels (on issues such as ID cards or road pricing) could really help shape the national debate - but with no presumption that if lots of representative citizen panels reach the same conclusion, the government must adopt that conclusion. Rather I would see the output of successful online discussions and deliberative panels as shaping media and parliamentary discussions - if these activities were organised in a way that gave them profile and legitimacy, then it would be hard for a government (or an opposition) to fly in their face. The point of the conversations would be to make "public opinion" a more genuine and effective force; it would be about finding ways to enable citizens to engage with debates currently seen as the preserve of political elites, but I don't think it can really be about moving to direct democracy either by the whole population or by small groups of supposedly representative citizens.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>The point of a conversation, presumably, is that you start it often not knowing where it is going to lead or whether indeed it has any purpose. Do we have an appetite for that kind of engagement with and between people in the policy process?  Maybe part of our challange is to learn that sometimes the best way to encourage people to become 'engaged' and to 'participate' is to invite them into settings where the conversation has an intrinsic, not an instrumental value.  Maybe part of our problem is that, too often the invitation (eg from Gordon Brown to talk about British values) comes across as altogether too structured and driven by someone else's agenda.  is there room for some 'aimless' conversation where the purpose isn't to conduct a form of opnion polling or to guage whether a nascent political idea is going to work, but simply because people want to talk and to listen.  For no particular purpose...</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>What I really liked about the netwokringdemocracy post is that it spells out the gap between government and web 2 people.
In particular, the 2 questions posed by the ministers are very frequently posed by decision-makers:
- how to make sense of large numbers of web contributions (if they occur) ?
- how to ensure both that there is a good input and that it is fairly representative and is secure from ‘capture’?
I have not thought it over but I feel great distance from these questions, they appear to me as missing the key points. I agree very much with your points on the goals of conversation. I agree also with Anthony Barnett that "while the Minister’s fears are understandable they may be misconceived".
So this debate is very important because it shows the GAP between perception and reality of web 2.0, or if you want between those who get it and those who don't. 
This shows that we ("people who get it") haven't been able to communicate our point of view.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Very nicely put - you've nailed a really important issue here, which the gap between the sensibilities and instincts of the 'net' generation (as a crude shorthand for those who 'get it') and the sensibilities and instincts of those inside the public policy process.  One of the biggest issues is around representativeness.  In the real world, we all know that coming across really great insights and fabulous ideas is not about representativeness.  It's about being open to lots of possible conversations, listening carefully and having the judgement to recognise a great idea when you see (or hear) one.  The best idea might come from one person or an unexpected and "unrepresentative" source.  Does that mean the policy process has to effectively throw good ideas back into the water because they weren't caught in the right 'representative' way.  Sorry about the mangled metaphor but i think you get the drift.  

The other big issue you've tapped, and which is implicit in Paul's contribution, is what tools and capabilities the public sector needs in order to be able to render the pubic conversation, in whatever form it is accessed, accessible and meaningful in terms that the policy process can, well, process.  Digesting the new public conversations and turning them into purposeful policy and actionable responses is definitely one of the new tricks that the 21st centiry public sector has to learn.  We still need institutions, and even institutions with strong hierarchies, at least at times, but we need institutions and thier hierarchies that adapt to the new demands for engagement and responsiveness.  Not an easy call...</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, UK Cabinet Office Minister Hazel Blears gave a speech about eGovernment and eDemocracy. Her concerns focused on the success, or otherwise, of local government.  These two blog responses brought me up a bit sharply.  The first was clearly sceptical:

"That's good coming from Blears! Local government, with a few exceptions, hasn't had a problem with revolutionising services, its central government that's been lagging and we get tired of hearing it the other way around.

I've spent the day chairing a meeting of the Yorkshire &amp; Humber branch of the Society for Information Technology Management (the British public service IT managers body) focused on digital inclusion. It was lead by several examples of good practice and then by an attempt to discover the
barriers - the conclusion was that the UK lacked a national agenda for digital inclusion! We are potentially replicating the scandal of e-government where nearly four hundred councils did their own thing in different timescales but without the financial input!"

You get the idea...

The second blog was from former Cisco eDemocracy professor, now Professor of Political Communication at Leeds, Stephen Coleman:

"Even by the standard of other Ministerial statements in which politicians clearly have little to say, this seems to have been an extraordinarily vacuous speech. Hazel Blears refers to how online 'dialogue helps us make a better policy that really reflects what people need and want', but did not give a
single example of how such public input has led to policy that is in any way different, better-informed or more representative.

Referring to the Number Ten e-petitions, Hazel Blears cites 'Burma, Capital Gains Tax, The police pay deal' as examples of important public input. The questions she needs to answer, if her commitment to e-democracy is to be taken at all seriously, are i) how have these e-petitions contributed to government policy-making; and ii) how does she know what contribution they made in the absence of any evaluation of the Number Ten e-petitions project?

Although Hazel Blears' speech was short on detail, it was revealing for a couple of issues not mentioned. Firstly, amongst the successful e-democracy projects cited (Netmums, MySociety), there was no mention of any of the
projects launched by the government as part of its national local e-democracy project. It would have been interesting to hear how many of these are still going and are seen as contributing to government policy-making at any level.
Secondly, there was no reference to the government's own e-democracy centre (ICELE), which is odd considering that this is probably the main area of government spending on e-democracy. I suspect that these non-references were
the most important part of the speech."

Stephen has never found it hard to tell us what he really thinks!  But it got me thinking that maybe we need to give ourselves a reality check here.

Those of us who either from personal commitment or professional necessity spend much of our time living in, and extolling the virtues of the wonderful world of connected everything sometimes have to stand back a bit and wonder if we aren't having ourselves on a bit. These two posts ask some critical questions? Can you advance the cause of transformation in the absence of national commitments and platforms, expecting all of the ‘small pieces' to ‘loosely join' as if by some sort of spontaneous policy combustion?

What exactly is the evidence that all of this online wizadry and digital hyperactivity adds to more than a few self-absorbed geeks with nothing else to do on a Saturday afternoon? What has been the real outcome - policy done differently (or even perhpas better?), better decisions made faster, people served and supported in truly mould-breaking ways?

It is tempting to look at the evidence of the last 10 to 12 years - roughly the period of the concerted eGovernment ‘project' for most developed countries at least - and get a sense of nowhere near enough real change or movement.

 For the most part, government is not being done in recognizably different ways and certainly not ways that, in any reasonable interpretation of the world, would count as ‘transformation' . Underlying structures and systems remain largely unchanged. It's even harder to discern much real shift in underlying culture and behavour. The compelling and provocative insights of the kind of world that Charles Leadbeater sketches in his new book We Think (as just one example of many analysts and writers) - open, collaborative, subject to new forms of collective intelligence, breaking doewn the silos etc - are notable too often for their absence in the settled and intractable world of public policy and public management.

Am I being unfair?]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Funny thing Martin, as I was about to blog on something very much aligned to this subject...it was in fact, going to be based on a story you'd sent me recently.  The former British health secretary, Alan Milburn, wrote an op-ed in The Australian entitled, "Power to the People" http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23411791-26040,00.html

In it, he makes points that some would consider axiomatic, such as,  "Today politics is struggling to come to terms with great changes: more assertive citizens, more diverse societies and more globalised economies. Together they call for new ideas, particularly a new relationship between the state and the citizen.  As yet that call goes unheeded."  Others would read this as more of the same empty rhetoric...how many times has an elected (or aspiring-to-be) official called for new ideas and new relationships? 

No matter which side of the ledger your opinion falls on the above, he does make some important comments around the paradox of decreasing voter turnout with increasing volunteerism and likewise, around the fact that the state cannot solve vexing issues without citizen involvement.

What's totally stuck in my craw (beyond the cavalier and context-free statement about cutting the UK Public Service by "a quarter") is his position on "the choice agenda in public services".  Amongst other suggestions, I scratch my head at the comment about giving poorer people budgets from which they can "make school choices real, not rhetorical".  Shouldn't there be a focus (to your point, a "national commitment or platform") on making public education more consistent?  In the absence of central leadership and that's really what we're talking about, this strikes me, as does much of the so-called choice agenda, as being more theatrical than legitimately valuable or game-changing.  

Perhaps the one statement in his piece that really took my breath away was this one..."Minimum standards would be set nationally that local services could exceed locally."  Minimum standards in the public context are not generally "exceeded"; this is no slight to the great work of public servants around the world, it's ultimately a simple reality, when we speak of competing demands, public monies, fiduciary responsibility and probity.  He may have been playing to his audience, but it hints at the huge disconnect that exists in so many places between elected officials and public servants, further confounding harmonious or progressive policy dialogues.

Milburn suggests that his vision creates a situation  "where power is relocated to the lowest possible level".  Perhaps, or is it a rather heavy-handed, even insidious approach to addressing policy failings and gaps in service capability, delivery and readiness by essentially abrogating huge swaths of public service responsibility?

There's no doubt that certain services are and should be downloaded to users, but is this being done in any coordinated manner that would speak to a plan underpinned by sound policy?  You're right that small pieces won't loosely join by "spontaneous policy combustion" (great phrase by the way!)...an accountable and strong "centre" enabled, emdoldened and empowered by strong policy, needs to be firmly established if the potential of the connected-anything is to be realized.  Until then, all of this "online wizardry and digital hyeractivity" (yet another great phrase) will continue to be somewhat blithely considered as just another "channel"...

In order for government to be done in "recognizably different ways", there needs to be recognizably different leadership.  That leadership is 100% rooted in policy, whether we care to embrace that fact or not.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Agree that politicians in some situations have embraced the choice model, coupled with a subsidiarity rhetoric that I sometimes wonder if they really understand, on a pretty flimsy pretext and without much consideration.  But I'm less inclined to throw out the choice stuff, if it's done properly. And doing it properly is at least partly about the way you set up the game.  

I think the disconnect  between the stats on engagement in formal politics and active and growing participation in less structured, but still highly political issues and campaigns, speaks powerfully to the instinct for authenticity and autonomy of which people need at least a measure to convince them that getting involved or taking up the 'self service' option is worth it.  

So what I suspect is the key here is - and I know this will sound like flakey consulting language, but hey, it's what i do for a living! - you need the right mix of both.  A strong guiding central policy framework that sets up and manages the rules of engagement, as it were, and at the same time looking for lots and lots of ways to give people the chance to take on legitimate responsibility for their own lives, for some degree of self-service and choice and for some degree of joining up loosely.  Strikes me that there is a sense in which people, given the right conditions, will spontaneously combust and cohere but it doesn't happen in a vacuum.  That's the point, I guess.  

The best recent exposition of this truth, by the way, that I have seen recently is Charles Leadebeater's "We Think", the first three chapters of which you can download from his We Think site.  A great mix of powerful insights into new ways of "organising without oranisations" and understanding the pragmatic design principles that make this spontaneity happen...</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the 'Designing for Civil Society" discussion comes some salutary insights and wise advice from Tom Steinberg, MySociety founder and generally all-round smart thinker (and do-er) in the government 2.0 space.

In a post to the UK and Ireland E-Democracy Exchange, Tom writes "mySociety has traditionally worked on the assumption that it's basically impossible to ever get any part of any government to do anything of any real significance in the field of edemocracy, or in the wider field of greater access to data.
As a result we've always tried to pick projects that work as well as possible for the citizen without requiring government to do anything it didn't do before (think FixMyStreet, or WriteToThem). Picking a project that requires a bit of government to move a single inch in order for your project to work at all is a sadly proven path to failure.

Unfortunately, our need to campaign today is a validation of this highly pessimistic approach. It is absurd that this campaign is even necessary, given that we tried so hard to do it the 'nice way' with meetings, gentle encouragement and nicely written word documents in Whitehall-speak explaining why it was useful and cheap and non-threatening. But where it counted the unelected officials who hold the relevent power here just weren't persuadable for reasons that we're having to FOI to find out."

So, that's a bit disappointing.  But as an antidote to such a pragmatic assessment, Tom offers some advice. Instead of looking at what e-democracy projects don't achieve in terms of mass engagement, it is better to look at "pressure points, chinks in the armour where improvements might be possible, whether with the consent of government or not".

He concludes:

"Anyway, if this seems like a counsel of despair, it isn't supposed to be. I'm just saying that being realistic about the nature of actual progress in our field (tiny, incremental, currently peaking with things like TheyWorkForYou and Stemwijzer.nl ) makes for more interesting, useful discussions than comparing everything to the Holy Grail of True, Mass Scale Deliberative Democracy"

Small pieces, it seems, will 'loosely join' to achieve the larger 'transformation' only if we acept tht the real vaue we're after will inevitably be subverted by premature and over-weening ambitions for scale and scope.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Martin - thanks so much for the mention. Here's the link in case people want to see the source. http://tinyurl.com/32y86b. I was counterpointing Tom's approach with that of the "big conversation" favoured by  OurKingdom ... and asking: If we talk, will Government listen?
By the way, what were the sources for the quotes in the other reality checks? I know I've published the Stephen Coleman quote, but I wondered about the other.
In terms of what might work, it is interesting to see both Cabinet Minister Tom Watson and the BBC http://tinyurl.com/2glo2u favouring working with existing sites, blogs etc rather than setting up new ones. Aggregation and facilitation is going to be a big issue.
It's a great help for connectedrepublic.org to promote these conversations. I'll be adding another dimension at http://socialreporter.com
Incidently, you'll find Stephen Coleman currently guest blogging at Connecting Bristol http://tinyurl.com/3x4v9g</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>It's a pleasure - Desigining for Civil Society is one of my 'favourites' and an RSS regular.  The other quotes are from David Weinberger's book of the same name "Small Pieces, Loosely Joined".  

I think Tom Watson is right, by the way.  For the most part, governments are much better off going to where poeple are already having lively and meaningful conversations, and learning how to listen to them properly, than expecting them to join often dull and unimaginative sites to be 'consulted'.  I actually learned that from Stephen Coleman when he was Cisco Professor of eDemocracy at Oxford.  I shall chase him down on the Bristol blog...thanks for the lead.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A week-long eFestival of Ideas is currently on hosted by Sydney-based youth organisation Vibewire.  I'm contributing to a forum on "eParticipation: Fad or Future", which Cisco is sponsoring.

Come and have a look at the debate and join in.

<a href="http://www.vibewire.net/forum/view_topic?topic_id=86">http://www.vibewire.net/forum/view_topic?topic_id=86</a>

One of the other guest contributors, Mark Pesce, had this to say in a recent blog.  It will give you a flavour for the debate we're enjoying:

"The institution finds itself caught in a paradox: aggregation makes it powerful, but takes away its voice. When power was important, the institution prospered. Now that the cultural balance is shifting toward hyperempowered individuals engaging in conversation, the institution is under threat. It is being disempowered in a way that it can not adapt to without a fundamental restructuring of its organizational behavior. This is something that governments are only slowly coming to recognize, but educators (and, in particular, educational administrators) are already well aware that their students are more empowered than the educational institutions they attend. The desynchronization between the scope of institutional power and the chaos of unconstrained and unconstrainable conversational hyperempowerment presents a challenge that will transform the institution – or kill it."

He's right, I think - one of the dimensions of the current contest between government and the Web 2.0 world is a largely unspoken struggle between individuals and institutions.  If Pesce is on the right track, we can expect much more unhappiness and resistance from government in the face of the rise and rise of hyperempowerment.  Unless, of course, you think Pesce is talking through his bottom... ]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>To paraphrase another poster over at vibewire, I agree with this completely and I disagree with it completely.  There's no doubt in the broadly Western context that the individual is more empowered, at least from a depth and breadth of informed choice point-of-view.  Equally Martin, I agree that tension, spurred on by technology, exists and is growing between and across stakeholders.

However, "the chaos of unconstrained and unconstrainable conversational hyperempowerment" implies an extraordinarilly high level of participation by those same hyperempowered individuals.  What we've seen so far in the Web2.0 world is certainly a higher level of individual participation, but that doesn't or hasn't translated into those individuals being more "participative" in and around the institutions that they seek to transform...or kill.  Further, there's ample proof that whatever the increase in individual participation may be, it's still a long way from being a majority exercise (which I think would be the point).  As long as the dialogue revolves around a certain us vs them mentality, this is more electronic tilting at windmills.

At the risk of being branded some kind of apologist (gasp), I think there's a certain unreasonable impatience that runs through the dialogue; the institution isn't "under threat".  A phrase I'm not particularly fond of comes to mind; "he who has the gold makes the rules".  Unless we're advocating anarchy, then that will remain so, as it relates to "the institution".  The phrase as its used here puts me in mind of unionspeak; a company is "the employer", a kind of third-person dissociation...here, "our" or "your government" becomes "the institution" 

I also think that the institution actually understands the challenge (to varying degrees), but the ability for the institution to move in what some might think or want as a more timely or purposeful way, presupposes that the institution became what it is today (obscure Reggie Perrin reference) either deliberately or overnight.  

Without appropriate analysis, time and leadership (absolutely indisputably aided and abetted by technology), unwinding some of the historically deep complexities inherent in the institution will only lead to ultimately meaningless sops at best or to some ill-advised and irretrievable "choice agenda" or some such that will make us question both why we hurried and what exactly it was we were thinking...</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I tend to agree with Terry (and sadly even got his obscure Reggie Perrin reference). I think there are huge opportunities for citizen empowerment and that some citizens are to some extent much more empowered than they use to be, but I do not think that we are all hyper-empowered now. I have plenty of views of issues from Uk foreign policy to our ant-terrorist laws to how well the road was repaired outside my house one month ago, but I do not have much sense that central or local government wants to listen to my views much less instantly translate them into actions. And, of course, given that there are 60 million or so UK residents with widely differing views it is difficult for government to listen and impossible to act on every view that is expressed. So for me it is about: opening up decision-making, so everything is much more transparent; encouraging feedback and debate on a scale not seen in my part of the world since the ancient Greek city states; and then giving citizens the opportunities to find each other and come together as communities to make their views heard and have an impact. We need citizen empowerment and that can sometimes be a matter of individual choice; but much more we need transparency, feedback and empowered virtual communities.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I'm less sanguine about the resilience of the instiutions of public policy in the face of increasingly restless and effective citizens.  Not all of them, true and still in many ways something of a niche group, but the impact remains as potentially corrosive of the foundations of control and authority on which instutions are built even though the assult is being launched by a relatively small group of people.

But Terry's timely realism is an important anti-dote to a certain hysterical romanticism that can sometimes grip the more voluble and articulate spruikers of the wonderful world of hyerconnectivity.  Sometimes I think we can be some mesmerised by the astonishing things you can now do in virtual communities and by using these new collaboration platforms that we assume that excitement is the same as efficicacy.  

Institutions conserve and control.  Individuals (sometimes) test and disagree and seek to redraw the lines that define the interesting space in between.  The new tools connection and collaboration are, without doubt, rewriting the rules of engagement in that eternal contest and, in the process, redefining what exactly the right balance is or should be.

What we mean by "empowered" also needs some pinning down - making our voices heard, determining policy and decisions, being asked for our opinion?</wp:comment_content>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week I have been attending Cisco's e-leaders forum in the glorious city of Liverpool. The event brings together about sixty decision-makers from local authorities across Europe for two days of discussions on how they are using technology to transform their activities. As ever, it is striking to see the diversity of participants (from large cities like Liverpool and Amsterdam to small towns like Dunkerque or rural areas like La Manche) and yet the similarity of interests and experiences.

One of the highlights of the first day was David McElhinney's presentation on Liverpool's transformation experience. (all the presentations are available on the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/resources/" target="_blank">resources page</a>).
David's focus was using customer contact to drive up performance and drive down cost and at the heart of his philosophy was the paradoxical assumption that customer contact was essentially a failure, something that should be systematically managed down in many areas to an ideal target of zero. On this approach generating a large amount of customer contact is a reflection of excessively complicated processes imperfectly implemented. So the solution is to simplify the processes and move towards one single way of doing any generic activity - so one way of receiving payments whatever those payments might be, one way of making payments, one way of collecting debt etc. It was also striking how ruthlessly Liverpool have been prepared to apply this approach. For example, they simplified salary payments by moving everyone onto a monthly salary (12 payments a year is fewer chances for error and customer contact than 52 payments a year) and making all payments directly into the bank accounts of their staff. Employees who were not prepared to give their bank details were not paid - so most people did share their details quite quickly, although one person apparently held out for one year during which she was working but not actually receiving her salary!

Another interesting point David made related to customer relationship management (CRM). He argued that the council does not really have an interesting in having a full picture of its relationship with individual citizens, since if a customer gets in contact to complain about their rubbish bin not having been emptied, they are unlikely at the same time to want to discuss the recent planning application they made or their application for a resident's parking permit. So rather than having a comprehensive CRM tool, Liverpool cluster together activities and try to get a comprehensive picture of that particular area, so they have a CRM tool covering everyone who makes or should be making payments to them, a CRM tool that covers all those people to whom the council gives benefits of any kind (from payments to bus passes, disabled parking permits, free school meals etc). In relation to street scene issues they take a CRM-type approach, but the focus is assets on the streets (lamp-posts, bus shelters, drains etc), since the issue when someone gets in contact is having a clear picture of all the things on the street that the citizen might be wanting to raise an issue about. Again the value of this approach is that by clustering related issues together it helps Liverpool to simplify processes, reduce systems and enable front-line staff provide quick responses in those (hopefully ever-decreasing) situations where something goes wrong and the citizen rings up unhappy or confused.

At the other end of the spectrum from David's philosophy of moving to zero customer contact and in a rather interesting contrast, we also explored the issue of citizen participation and empowerment.  Here we heard from Carol Hayward of Bristol City council who are one of the leading councils in the UK in relation to e-democracy. Carol talking about the various initiatives the council has taken to drive up participation and to broaden it so that young people and other groups get much more involved in council decision-making. One tool they have been using for some time is an e-petition tool and there were a number of interesting aspects to the ways they were using that tool. Firstly, they have deliberately sought to encourage councilors to use the tool so that they see it as a way of testing public opinion rather than something that undermines the role. Secondly, they have been clear that the tool is about debating an issue and exploring attitudes, it is not a form of direct democracy. So the discussion forums that explore the issues raised by a petition are almost as important as the petition itself and it is not just a question of the number of signatures a petition manages to attract. They also webcast the council meetings, so ultimately when petition topics are discussed in council the public can see what weight councilors gave to their views and why the final decision was made. So two contrasting but not necessarily conflicting approaches and an interesting first day for the event. Of course, there was much I have not covered with interesting experiences from different countries on fibre to the home and wireless city projects, but maybe I will come back to some of that in my next post on this event.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><strong>Making government more invisible</strong>

People in government often like to think that government is important, failing to realise that they are seeing it from a rather unusual point of view.  For most people, most of the time, government is most successful when it is least visible, or perhap...</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_date_gmt>2008-04-22 13:03:25</wp:comment_date_gmt>
<wp:comment_content>Are we labouring under the weight of an unresolved contradiction here?  On the one hand, we're saying a good relationship with government is no relationship at all, or at least one that is so minimal and so stripped down to simple, generic and non-differentiated process that it all happens so that we barely notice.  

On the other hand, we urge governments to understand the needs, preferences and values of their citizens in order to be able to fashion programs and services that more closely fit the contours of thier lives and needs.  

So which is it?  

If I was a councillor on the Liverpool Council, I'm not sure I would want to know something only about all those who lodge complaints about development issues or the garbage service.  I would want to know that but I think I'd also be interested in how the citizens to whom I am accountable interact with the whole council and, from that information, to undstand better how the patterns of interaction build and change over time.  Do people who complain about the garbage service complaint most about the development issues?  Do we have a bunch of citizens who tend always to offer helpful advice or ideas when they interact with the council, even if it's across different areas?  Wouldn't we want to connect with those people and perhaps find a way to engage with them more deeply?

Maybe I'm kidding myself - and maybe that's why I'm unlikely to be a Liverpool Councillor (apart from the fact that I live in Sydney, which makes it harder).  But while I'm very sympathetic to the paradox - less customer engagement in government may be the signal of an outstanding council - I have a sense that it's not that simple.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>It's both.  

But it's both in a way which doesn't, on the whole, fit into the current model of local democracy.  I don't want to contact my council about the fact that they haven't collected my rubbish, because that should just happen, in the same way which lots of other services provided by lots of other organisations just happen.  And partly because of that, I don't think there is any particular value from having democratic control of rubbish collection.  

Some services divide neatly.  I live in an area where there is controlled street parking.  The question of whether that should apply at all, in which areas, with what mix of parking spaces and at what times of day seem to me to be of the essence of local collective decision making.  Having made that decision, the process of enforcing it - issuing the permits, monitoring infringement and issuing penalties - has nothing intrinsically local or democratic about it at all.  That just requires efficient and effective operational delivery.  I want to be deeply involved in the first set of decisions, but I now dream of the day when the renewal of my parking permit can be a zero-contact transaction.  The contacts which, I assume, David McElhinney was talking about are all in the second category, not the first.

So I think the question then becomes, what are the characteristics of a service or process which point to its best being delivered with some element of democratic engagement and control?   My guess is that if you tried to answer that systematically, you would end up with a list which looked familiar in some ways, but quite unfamiliar in others.

Much of the present mix - in the UK at least - is essentially accidental.  There was a time when gas supply was a municipal function; now it isn't.  Local authorities used to manage schools directly, now by and large they don't - though they are still responsible for ensuring that schools are available for those who need them.  They are responsible for licensing pubs, but not cars (though they used to do those too). And so on.

So how about this as a resolution to the paradox:  an outstanding council is one where there is plenty of engagement which is interesting, and as close as possible to no engagement at all which isn't interesting - where interesting means whatever you the customer/resident/elector choose to think is interesting.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've put in some links for the recent Australia 2020 exercise, which saw 1000 people selected to join the new Australian Prime Minister and some of his senior Ministers for a 2-day ideas and strategies session in Parliament House in Canberra last weekend.  

In many ways, the whole process can be seen as a powerful experiment in open innovation, a real attempt to throw open the traditionally impenetrable process of policy and decision making to a much wider influence.  The event was streamed on the web - at the web site, you will be able to review some of the session for the next few weeks I think - <a href="http://www.australia2020.gov.au/" title="http://www.australia2020.gov.au/">http://www.australia2020.gov.au/</a>.  It was also broadcast on ABC television (our public TV channel).

The event, which was the culmination of a process of smaller events in schools and communities around the country leading up to the Summit itself, has been the subject of much comment in the mainstream press and of course in the blogosphere.  Depending on your point of view, it was either a very clever political exercise in spin and issues management, ending up with a series of ideas pretty much along the lines of current government policy anyway, or a genuine attempt to create a richer and more interactive policy conversation.

My view is that the event manifests a little of both - clever politics without a doubt, but with some good ideas from an interesting diverse group of people responding to the dynamic of a collective deliberation process that provided some discipline and structure to move towards a few concrete proposals.

Much will depend, of course, on what happens next.  All of the material from the Summit is going to be posted on the web  The website already contains the thousands of submissions people sent through before the Summit in the 10 topics that formed the themes for the discussion.  The full write up of all the ideas and proposals that came out of the 2 days will also be on the site in a few weeks, I understand.  There is already an interim report (attached) which was actually presented to the PM before the end of the Summit itself!

PM Rudd has committed to responding to all the Summit's ideas, including those he and the government will not take forward.  

In may ways, despite the use of some new tools (eg web streaming - but it was only limited) the process was a reasonably "World 1.0" approach to a fairly traditional planning process.  But the potential of building on this first attempt and gradually introducing many more collaborative and interactive tools into the process is considerable.  Have a look at one blog post (I've put the extract at the end of this email) to illustrate how far some people feel the process still has to go to really harness the potential of the new tools of collaboration...

But as an example of a fairly ambitious and, for the most part, reasonably successful exercise in Government 2.0, and with real political leadership (the whole thing was led by the PM himself), it's a very worthy story.  ]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Here's a view from one blogger whose critique is largely driven by the sense that Australia 2020 was all a bit "World 1.0"...

I miss something from the coverage of the 2020 conference?  I saw people with pens and paper.  I saw no evidence of an internal wiki (or something similar) being used.  It seems they are using 1020 technology to manage the output of our best and brightest.

I hope I’m wrong, and that someone will point out my error.

If the government couldn’t organize a search engine, and collaborative software such as a wiki and electronic whiteboard software for participants (even if they had to bring their own laptops), then I’ve got to wonder how much thought actually went into organizing this in the most productive, forward looking way.

Imagine if all the participants were working on a wiki preloaded with all the papers by each participant, all the contributions by the public, links to public documents that supported their ideas, and all the categories and cross-references that could have been automagically munged with an SQL-savvy bot.

It’s not the ideas stupid, it’s self-organizing of ideas and linkages between them that creates value!  This is especially important when individuals are chatting to each other… they could easily have created tags and links between two ideas in two pages in a couple of seconds. And by close-of-business, a monkey could have run the stock standard wiki reports to produce tables of cross-references, most-linked-to pages, etc, etc, etc.

As they walked away, each participant could have been given the wiki export to take home and load up on their own computer, the wiki could have been made public with second-tier and invited-but-couldn’t-make-it folk given logins that allowed them to edit the pages.

It seems like the technology given to assist participants and make analysis and value-adding of their efforts actually useful was merely an advanced version of what was available in 1020: microphones and speakers replacing megaphones and loud voices, paper and textas rather than quills and parchment.  No real innovation, again, unless I missed it.

It’s not like our best and brightest wouldn’t know how to use a wiki given that wikipedia is in the top 5 read sites in the world, and millions of people have edited wiki pages (although not necessarily in the wikipedia).

I wonder if any of our best and brightest raised the idea beforehand, whether the government read the discussion paper on efficient electronic consultation mechanisms for a recent AGIMO inquiry and twigged that the same 21st century tools could be installed in a couple hours for this conference (a server, an OS, a wireless LAN, MySQL, Apache, a "Google mini", then give all participants the URL on the internal LAN and tell them to create their own wiki accounts).  It’d take less time than planning the seating arrangements!</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I think the unknown blogger is a little hopeful about the Best and Brightest being able to use a wiki.  My experience is that very few experienced Web users have such skills.

And that's not what they were there to do.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Agreed, Martin. Although the actions that emanate from the ideas are really the most important aspect, the use of basic contemporary tools as you suggest would actually help that translation point from ideas-forming to policy-forming and beyond. Our tools today enable translation, knowledge transfer, filtering, contextualisation, presentation etc., like no others have.

However, it was great to have ideas back on the agenda again in the first place. Totally welcome. Shame that cities and technology - and crucially the congruence of the two - weren't quite high enough on the agenda, but that leaves an opportunity to develop something there ...</wp:comment_content>

<title>Is the public sector &#8216;fit for purpose&#8217;?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years ago, the Australian Labor Party was led by a young man called Mark Latham.  His accession to the Labor leadership was somewhat unexpected but fuelled by a reputation for original policy thinking and an eclectic curiosity (one of his political opponents was once unkind enough to label his approach "policy by Google"). 

Mark's leadership crashed badly in the 2004 election following which he abruptly left politics altogether.  An iconoclastic writer and diarist, he's back in the mainstream Australian press with renewed vigour and, in my view, great insight.  This is from his most recent piece in the Australian Financial Review (1 May) in which he opines the emptiness of the social democrat ideas cupboard.  These few extracts from his article will give you a sense of his thesis.  It's confronting stuff.  I predict Mark will start to assume a kind of Cassandra-like status as a voice whose compelling insights will be undermined by people who will dismiss him for his previous political clumsiness.

   <font face="Times New Roman"> </font>The problem with the public sector, he writes, is its limited capacity for reform.  "It only has two tools available to it: legal coercion and financial entitlement.  Yet these are poorly suited to dealing with the social crisis of our times: the breakdown of relations between people."

He goes on to note that governments work on a top-down basis in an orderly, predictable and legally-sanctioned way.  Civil society, by contrast, couldn't be more different, "with its diffuse and disorderly approach to relationships.  The square peg of the state does not fit into the round hole of community life."

His example is from the recent Australia 2020 Summit, where the idea was floated that students could pay off some of their higher education fees debts by volunteering in community organisations.  For Mark, this is nothing less than transforming service into toil, swapping generosity and sacrifice for the ethic of a mercenary (sure I'll volunteer, so long as you pay me). 

He might be right. Before he became Labor leader, Mark was building a reputation as a powerful advocate of some new thinking about public policy and public management.  His instinct to reach for civil society might be seen by some as a little romantic, perhaps even romantic.  It seems he's returning to his theme as he emerges from his self-imposed exile followng his political failure.  Some might say it was a shame that he seemed to lose sight of his real agenda when he had the chance to do something about it.

<title>Social networks the platform of the future</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Australian business and technology analyst and writer Ross Dawson (Trends in the Living Networks - <a href="http://rossdawsonblog.com/">http://rossdawsonblog.com/</a>) has some interesting reflections on the growing significance of social networking as the dominant platform for commuication and value.

Here's his brief comments - <a href="http://rossdawsonblog.com/weblog/archives/2007/09/microsoft_faceb.html">http://rossdawsonblog.com/weblog/archives/2007/09/microsoft_faceb.html</a>.  A couple of quick excerpts:

"Value is increasingly seen as shifting to social networks. When News Corp bought MySpace 2 ½ years ago for $580 million, I pointed out that what it was buying was the positioning at the interstices of people's relationships. Media - as in the flow of information - is increasingly between people rather than in a hub and spoke arrangement, which makes social networking platforms central to value creation."

"Social networks are rapidly becoming central to people's interaction with the online world." Really - not sure everyone would agree with that yet, but perhaps we are launched on a trajectory whose outcome will justify that claim eventually?

"This is all about the platform of the future. The computing platforms of the past have been dominated by Windows. More recently the level of the dominant and meaningful platform is the web-based application. It is quite likely that the level of the platform that can extract the most value in the future is at or close to the level of the social network."

Thing that struck me is the link between these insights and the lask post I blogged about former Australian Labor Party  leader Mark Latham who suggested real reform in politics was always going to be difficult because it had to be grounded in people and relationships, not institutions.

Maybe there's a link between Mark's political insight and Ross Dawson's focus on social networks.  If that's right, then the idea of "government by Facebook" isn't so silly, perhaps, except that it would mean something much more profound than putting a few announcements on a static and highly controlled facebook page.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I had an interesting conversation with Ivo Gormley from <a href="http://thinkpublic.com/news/index.php" target="_blank">ThinkPublic</a>, an interesting group of young designers and others committed to making public services better for everyone. Ivo (an antropologist) by background told me about an interesting film he hopes to complete shortly on Government 2.0 and which I hope we will at some point feature on this site. He also talked about some of the work ThinkPublic have been doing in the health service to develop bottom-up approaches to business process re-engineering. So rather than some consultants working out the perfect process and imposing this on recalcitrant reality (and even more recalcitrant staff);  staff and users are invited to record their experiences about  which bits of the process work well and feel good and this is then used as the basis for staff and users to work together in small teams to devise improvements to the process.

This sounded fascinating to me and it would be great to understand the process better and get some sense of what comes out of it. And that's the rub. We were actually meeting to discuss Ivo's idea of creating a vehicle for short, monthly videos that would highlight public sector innovation and invite others to comment, rate and emulate. It's not clear where the best place for doing this is - should it be inside government, since it is about improving the public sector and showcasing interesting new ideas? If so, should it be across all sectors or does it make more sense to have different vehicles for different parts of the public sector, since more targeted sites will presumably be more compelling for the parts they are targeted on?  Or is it better coming from outside government to give more freedom and avoid the risk of the exercise turning into an empty marketing exercise? And of course there are plenty of other questions. Should this be internal to the public sector or accessible to everyone? Would the point mainly be to flag up interesting initiative around the UK or would the discussions of those examples be almost as important as the examples themselves?

Obviously there is no one answer to any of these questions and Ivo's idea could be developed in all sorts of directions, but what struck me is that I am not aware of many examples of this kind of thing going on here or elsewhere. Surely there must be some good internal tools that bring public sector workers together round examples of public sector innovation and encourage them to comment on and rate them? Surely there must be some administrations that are looking at this kind of thing both for the value it creates but also for the PR/"brand" benefit? I am sure there must be some, and of course the purely internal tools will not be visible to outsiders, but I would be very interested to hear from people with any examples they may have. In the meantime good luck to Ivo as he takes his idea forward and hopefully one day I will be able to update you on where he got to!]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>I like the Kent examples particularly the second one that shows some interesting applications of different tools. These examples do show the power of video for communicating and it would also be interesting to promote comments and discussions round the videos. Another example of the public sector using the web in an interesting way to showcase innovation is http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/fco-in-action/map; again, however, it would be interesting if they linked that out in suggestions as to what they might do next or what their priorities were etc etc.</wp:comment_content>

<title>Government 2.0 - an adventure in wiki-land</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's great to be able to announce that we are now ready to test <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">the wiki facility</a> on this site and see if we as a community can manage to collaborate on some thoughtleadership. Not surprisingly, we thought we would start with the topic of Government 2.0 and with a bit of help from Martin and Russell I have put together a series of seven principles as a starting point for the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/wiki/Government_2.0" target="_blank">discussion</a>. We are using Mediawiki - which is the same tool used for wikipedia and which takes a little bit of getting used to. I am afraid that to contribute you will have to register again on the wiki, but I suggest you use the same username and password as you have for the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/forums/" target="_blank">Forums</a> which should keep things relatively simple.

To be frank I am not entirely sure how a wiki-based discussion is going to work on this sort of topic and it was quite difficult to work out the best way to set up the discussion that would maximise the freedom for people to contribute, while enabling newcomers to the discussion to understand the starting point and have a reasonable overview of what is happening. I have protected the  frontpage with the original set of principles, so the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/wiki/Government_2.0" target="_blank">starting point</a> remains unchanged; but then there are pages to discuss each principle, point out the advantages and disadvantages of moving in the direction the principle points to and (most importantly) to add examples of that principle in practice. I am quite happy for the discussion to spiral off in all sorts of directions, so for example if someone wants to write about the pros and cons of blogging by ministers/senior politicians, they might flag up this issue in relation to the principle of openness and transparency and then create a linked new page to start a detailed discussion on this particular sub-topic. I will try to moderate the discussion, not to change the content but to keep the shape of the discussion as clear as possible so it is as easy as possible to contribute to it and enjoy it. However, please do get involved and contribute to the <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/wiki/Government_2.0" target="_blank">wiki discussion </a>- otherwise we will never work out the right way of doing this kind of thing!

In terms of the seven principles themselves, I tried to capture what I see as the main features of Government 2.0 - for me its a shift to a less hierarchical public sector; a collaborative, joined-up public sector; a broader sector that brings together all organisations working with a public purpose; a world where citizens are empowered; where public bodies are feedback-driven; where they are radically more open and transparent; and where the government's role is much more facilitative than controlling or delivering.  I hope the discussion will explore which of these principles are the most important and (a slightly different question!) which of them are we really going to see translated into reality in the next five to ten years; what are the main barriers to the type of shift each principle seeks to capture; and what are the best examples of initiatives that already embody these principles and what lessons do those initiatives provide.

It will also be interesting to see which principles generate the most interest and enthusiasm and eventually of course we may come back and decide that we have split up the terrain slightly wrongly and that rather than the seven principles listed, we need four or five principles with some of the current ones merged or cast in a different way. Who knows? This is an adventure and lets see where we end up! Reactions and comments are very welcome to this post, but I hope you will feel sufficiently interested in this project to go to <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">the wiki</a>, spend (literally) 30 seconds creating a wiki account and then start editing pages and adding content. As I said initially, MediaWiki does take a tiny bit of getting used to, but a side benefit is that you will also be training yourself up to contribute to Wikipedia (and the many other sites that use MediaWiki).]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Thanks for starting this up. I work for an organization dedicated to making the public sector more efficient and effective in their marketing/engagement efforts with citizens here in Canada. Effective use and understanding of social media/web 2.0 is an obvious core component of this and main focus of my blog. I will try to contribute regularly. Cheers!

<wp:comment_content>How does Government 2.0 relate to repression, not to say arrest of
dissenters, by the Chinese police?  Much of their surveillance and their 
attempts to curtail the free flow of information is enabled with Cisco gear.
Several arrests, not to mention the complete disappearance of critics,
has come precisely from technology enabling exchange of information on
public blogs and chat rooms (often monitored and even participated in by police)
Not to pick on Cisco however, but how does technology in and of itself 
create a  flow of information between citizens and bureacracies 
or governments that causes positive social change?  So what if a Philipino
citizen messages in that a bus is spewing black smoke? No one is going
to do anything without authorization, funds, and motivation.  That message
is just as likely to be ignored as cause any action.  Perhaps it will even
cause the only effective action to not be taken at all.  Technology is a tool,
but no one seems to want to examine the effects of that tool's growth and
pervasiveness on institutions that are strongly driven by other factors. 
It seems to me it mixes with those other factors in a highly complex way.
Might be good--might be bad, when and if you could ever weigh it all in
the balance.  Someone needs to make that analysis, and it isn't going to
be easy.   As Mao Tse-Tung said "Political power grows out of the
barrel of a gun".  And the more the technology of the gun advanced,
the more power to those with the guns.  Just one of the paradoxes of
technology, it seems to me... thanks, Mario</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>And of course history is replete with examples of people who have used the power from the barrel of the gun to repress and others to liberate.  As Mario says, this is not a question that is susceptible to a simplistic "technology is good" versus "technology is bad" response.

I think Mario's basic point, though, is spot on.  The real debate here should not be about the cool and groovy things you can do with technology, and the ways in which those capabilities can be badly abused by people intent on doing others harm.  The real debate is about the interaction of technologies, many of which are capable of being pressed into the service of a society that is more open, inclusive and accountable, and the instiutions and people who determine whether they will be allowed to realise their ambitions.

That, it strikes me, is the fundamental debate at the heart of the 'connected republic'.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks for friend and NSW Government colleague  Ken Dray for pointing out this great piece from the US about the state of the official federal government blogopshere - <a href="http://www.fcw.com/print/22_13/management/152465-1.html?topic=management">http://www.fcw.com/print/22_13/management/152465-1.html?topic=management</a>.

It's worth a read...some great insights from those inside government who are pioneering the use of blogs not just as yet another channel to reinforce the dismal one-way conversation that so often passes for 'communications' and 'collaboration' in government, but as a potent and incredibly useful two-way interactive platform that informs, educates, debates and occasionally, it seems, entertains.

"Government bloggers are now writing about every conceivable subject, including the Middle East peace process, federal agency management techniques and rock singers with drug problems. The era of government blogging has dawned."  One of the internal users from Health commented that she viewed blogs as the mode of communication for the future. Communicating through them will one day become as routine and frequent as an agency issuing a press release, she said. "Eventually, we'll get there."

Another reported a recent trip to Iraq, where he saw 20-year-old soldiers operating a dozen chat sessions at once while they were monitoring their functional areas.

"It's the use of this type of Web 2.0 technology by the net generation - the 18- to 30-year olds - that has motivated me to start a blog...this age group is the reality of who our new recruits are, and this is the technology they are comfortable with. It makes sense to use it."

Another noted that millions and millions of people, including poeple in government, get a lot of information from blogs. "There's no going back."

Indeed - might be something worth putting into the mix as we think through what the public sector of the 21st century is going to have to look like if we are to attract the requisite workforce to do an increasingly complex job in public management. ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The quote below is from an article by Seth Finkelstein that I read today in the Sydney Morning Herald.  Every time my romantic inner self is predisposed to celebrate the proliferating and apparently unstoppable freedom of the Internet and the new power of the participative web, I read statements like this.  The real world is unlikely to be be as untramelled as we might like to hope...

"It's sometimes suggested that we are entering a new internet era with blogs and syndication feeds and massive digital sharecropping sites that will, on the whole, be more difficult to censor.

My response is to remind people that identical rhetoric was heard at the start of the internet's popularisation. And we're all witnessing how wrong those predictions were.

Indeed, there's every reason to expect that similar trends such as centralisation, willingness of corporations to collaborate, the power of the market for repression and so on will be applied to these forms of communication.

The failure of technological determinism just a short while ago should argue strongly against such baseless optimism."

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Australia's smallest state, the island of Tasmania off the south eastern coast, has just had a bloodless coup. 

<a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23764043-5006788,00.html">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23764043-5006788,00.html</a> 

Former Premier Paul Lennon fell on his sword in the wake of several scandals and political turmoil over a pulp mill proposal, to be replaced  by David Bartlett, 40 years old and only 4 years in politics.  Hiw new deputy, Lara Giddings, is 36.  Both represent the first burst of Generation X political leadership in Australia. 

Bartlett apparently has had a successful career in IT and intellectual property before entering politics.  He summed up his vision for the State that he will now be leading, describing the future he wanted to create for citizens as "clever, kind and connected". 

Apart from being a likely contender for best modern political slogan (it's got everything - the desire to be smart and innovative, the inference of a socially inclusive and compassionate approach and, best of all, the wonderfully ambiguous and multi-faceted notion of 'connected' - technologically, socially, politically), it's one of the best summations I've seen from a political leader that puts the focus on 'connectedness' right at the heart of the political program.  This is exactly the kind of outcome that the IBSG Public Sector team at Cisco would want to see - a political leader who evidently 'gets it' about the central role that connectedness plays in powering innovation, inclusion and democratic renewal.

It will be interesting to see how he turns the slogan into a program.   ]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>As you say, Martin, what a good slogan. We could do with a slice of Bartlett and Giddings in the UK at the moment, I believe, where the average senior politician seems to survive on an ethic of "conniving, vindictive and unhitched"!</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Trebuchet MS"><font face="Times New Roman">Last week, I had the opportunity to moderate the opening session of the “<strong>Next Rev – The Social Innovation International Congress</strong>”, in Lisbon. Organized by the Portuguese NGO Tese and by Young Foundation, with Cisco support, the two days of the excellent congress gathered nearly 300 participants, including an impressive international group of social innovators.  </font></font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS"><font face="Times New Roman">Professor Anibal Cavaco Silva, the President of the Portuguese Republic, participated in the conference, which focused on the application of social innovation in three thematic areas: education and employment, health and quality of life, and communities and participation. </font></font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS"><font face="Times New Roman">The goals of the Conference were: to show what Social Innovation is, where and how it happens, to inspire the existing and potential changemakers and to accelerate Social Innovation in Portugal and in the World.The venue was the auditorium of the Gulbenkian Foundation, an excellent auditorium with a window overlooking the Foundation beautiful gardens. The Portuguese President Cavaco Silva, opened the event. On a bold speech, the Head of State explained why social exclusion  is an area to which he have given special attention since the beginning of his mandate as President of the Republic. “I put forward for a civic commitment for social inclusion, I carried out the campaigns of the Route dedicated to this theme, I assumed as a main concern the identification and the dissemination of good practices in what nowadays is known as the third sector, that of social economy”, he said. “I congregated with organizations of voluntary workers dedicated to the development of new management skills in private institutions of social solidarity, or to promote networks of mutual aid and cooperation, with the objective to share donated goods or food products received daily”. </font></font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS"><font face="Times New Roman">The President explained how Social Innovation is instrumental: “It was an unforgettable experience which helped to perceive the extraordinary impact that social innovation can have in the answer to the identified social needs, and to understand how a new generation of social responses is being developed that breaks away from the traditional means of intervention. It is urgent, however, that this new generation of social responses is extended to the problems which are late in being overcome.”.The Portuguese President emphasized “the problem of ageing associated to the pressure for early inactivity, especially that resulting from the recourse to early retirement or unemployment of thousands of workers who are too young to go into retirement, but already too old to resume a professional activity. The <strong>waste of human capital</strong> that this event represents is manifest, but the i<strong>ndignity and lack of respect for the human being which it reveals is intolerable</strong>.” Prof. Cavaco Silva advocated “the promotion of the principle of <strong>active ageing</strong>, with recourse to innovating remedies that provide flexibility to the transition from active life to retirement. The knowledge and experience accumulated throughout their professional lives would thus be valued, with benefits accruing to society and to them. <strong>This is a clear example of Social Innovation which should be urgently materialized</strong>.” How? “It is important to create platforms of assessment, dissemination and monitoring of the good practices of social innovation and, at the same time, develop a culture of cooperation, structure a network in which performers and organizations may share, and promote the new answers for the new social needs”, concluded the Prof. Cavaco Silva  </font></font><font face="Trebuchet MS"><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></font><font face="Trebuchet MS"><font face="Times New Roman">In Europe, <strong>ageing well</strong> will clearly be one of the most urgent themes on the political agenda of this decade. The combination of pervasive connectivity, collaboration and innovative social policies will be instrumental to tackle this <strong>fundamental challenge</strong>.

<wp:comment_content>The big challange is not so much to nurture social innovation, although that is clearly a compelling challenge.  Just as important will be the way we weave the results of social innovation into the larger fabric of public policy.  Right now, I sense that mainstream policy makers, while they are more or less committed to the idea of social innovation, have few ideas about how to deal with its outcomes.  

So, for the most part, we have a 'business as usual' policy process and a 'business very much not as usual' social innovation community busy thinking and testing new ways to deal with the same set of risks ands opportunities that the mainstream policy makers are grappling with.  But somewhere the two groups never meet.  

Do you think that's fair?  Maybe it is happening quietly and without too much fuss or fanfare, but my impression right now is that social innovation and mainstream policy making are ships passing in the night.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>I don't see Social Innovation as a mainstream priority for policy makers. For instance, the current energy crisis is a great opportunity to innovate.However,  this has not yet been take seriously by public sector leaders. Most of them still have a "command and control" mindset. 

Social Innovation requires a major cultural shift that implies new skills and new attitude. It requires a public sector in an intense pro-activity, sensing and stimulating the citizens to play a role on the configuration of the services, shaping society in new ways never tested before. It requires ability to scale project pilots, new ideas. It's a new paradigm of interaction and involvement, who is not compatible with a "business as usual" way. "Out of the box" thinking must be encourage. 

That's what a Connected Republic should look like: a connected nation able to find and transform isolated islands of excellence and innovation into mainstream public policies.Funding, incubation, putting problems, competition, fast testing, prototyping and mobilizing front line users are some of the pragmatic ways to make that happen, as Geoff Mulgan suggested on the Social Innovation Congress

That's why we need to encourage every city, region and nation to take Social Innovation seriously. On the 90's, companies start seeing innovation as something instrumental for them to survive. Those who didn't innovate are out of business. 

It's time for public sector city, regional and national leaders to take Social Innovation seriously - not as a fade, but as a core policy.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Is part of the problem that the embrace of a "major cultural shift" which Diogo rightly identifies as central to the uptake of social innovation by mainstream policy processes requires considerable shifts in power, authoirity and accountability?

Do you think it is right that to become not just tolerant of social innovation, but positively to embrace its ethic and practices, mainstream policy processes have to entertain the notion that they may end up having less power and control than they are used to?  

If that is true - and I think basically it is - then we are in for a long wait because, for the most part, human institutions are not all thta good at voluntarilty dismantling themslves to privilege a new distribution of power and, at the same time, deny themselves that power with which they have become very comfortable.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Times New Roman">I was delighted to meet <strong>Peter Amstrong</strong> and his lovely wife <strong>Anuradha</strong> on the Social Innovation Congress. They are two amazing examples of social entrepreneurs. Peter and Anuradha are the founders of OneWorld, a cutting edge in harnessing media technology to benefit people who need it most. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Peter was a vibrant speaker on the panel I chaired. He explained how OneWorld leverages media innovatively for a fair and sustainable world. If you want to read what people around the world say about their climate-related experiences, <a href="http://www.oneclimate.net/experiences">http://www.oneclimate.net/experiences</a>  is the right place.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">The way OneClimate uses technology to promote sustainability is truly fascinating. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">“I predict that in ten years, we will use virtual worlds instead of traveling”, said Peter on our debate.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">During the Congress, I had the change to lunch with Peter and Anuradha. A few days later, I got a very nice email from Peter:</font>

<font face="Times New Roman"><em>“Anuradha and I were really delighted to meet you this week. It was a highlight of the Lisbon conference for us. I've put a short report of our conversation up on the front page of OneClimate. It's linked from </em></font><a href="http://www.oneclimate.net/"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>http://www.oneclimate.net</em></font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><em>. For us it pulled together so many important themes that we'd love to develop with you more going forward. We look forward to meeting in London as soon as we are back and continuing the conversation.”</em> Me too.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">See my interview <a href="http://www.oneclimate.net/2008/06/01/become-energy-empowered/">here</a>.  </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">And now please j</font><font face="Times New Roman">oin OneClimate and put yourself in the map. Click <a href="http://www.oneclimate.net/member/register?join.x=38&amp;join.y=17">here</a> and engage. </font>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<font face="Times New Roman">The opening panel I chaired at the Social Innovation International Congress had an excellent trio of speakers: Geoff Mulgan, Peter Armstrong and Richard Wilson. Geoff needs no presentation, since he is the world's thought leader on social innovation. He was the founder of Demos, was former Director of Tony Blair’s policy unit and is now Director of Young Foundation, an inspiring London-based institution. Peter is the co-founder of Oneworld, a cutting edge in harnessing media technology to benefit people who need it most (see previous post). Richard is a co-founder of Involve, a new organization focused on the practical issues of making public participation work and has written and spoken widely on public participation and democracy at home and abroad. All three panelists did very well and their presentations were followed by a vibrant discussion. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">On his keynote speech, Geoff made the case for social innovation. </font><font face="Times New Roman">There is a growing convergence of governments, business and civic society around the need for acting together.  </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Here are the ten <strong>thesis on Social Innovation,</strong> presented by Geoff: </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">1. <strong>The world has a deficit of social innovation</strong>. Existing models are inadequate to cope with ageing population, climate change, equality, diversity, drugs, well being, etc.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">2. <strong>There is a widening gulf between business and society.</strong> It’s a mismatch between how economy grows and how society develops.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">3. <strong>There is no shortage of creativity</strong>. There are many promising projects and we can learn a lot from them. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">4. However, something is missing:  <strong>the system for turning promising ideas to scale is inadequate and far inferior to those in science and business</strong>. That’s why there is this deficit. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">5. <strong>Many fields can contribute methods and insights to social innovation</strong>. How to set the conditions to innovate? How to scale and to difuse?</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">6. <strong>We need better ways to design, incubate and supply new ideas and models</strong> – feed by crisis, curiosity, combination. We have to do that trough funding, incubation, putting problems, competition, fast testing, prototyping and mobilizing front line users.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">7. <strong>Large scale impact depends on better ways to spread innovations and mobilize demand, using capital, commissioning and collaboration.</strong></font>

<font face="Times New Roman">8. <strong>Demand and supply need to be linked by intermediaries</strong>. We both need <strong>the bees and the trees</strong>. The <strong>bees </strong>have great ideas but no power, the <strong>trees</strong> have great power, but no ideas.  Social Innovation exchange is a good way to cross pollination networks. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman">9. <strong>Every city, every region, every country should cultivate its own capacity to innovate solutions its own social problems</strong>.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">10. <strong>We need to bring all these elements together so that social growth to mach economic growth</strong>.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman"><strong>"We need to start thinking on a new Lisbon Agenda"</strong>, said Geoff. A new Lisbon Agenda to mobilize the hearts and minds of all the European innovators. An agenda with the aim of spread innovations in all aspects of society. </font><font face="Times New Roman">The current financial crises, the ageing population, the threat of climate change; all these major challenges will require new innovative answers. I couldn't agree more .</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Traditional programs and policies, built around silos and on a command and control mood, are not longer sustainable solutions. All this major challenges requires structural transformations on the way we live and on the public sector works. Europe’s most intransigent problems demand solutions depending on cross-sectoral cooperation and innovation. That’s why social innovation must be a key priority: new solutions are needed and this solutions must involve citizen’s participation.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">As Geoff said, Europe’s in this century will depend on its ability to innovate in all sectors and across all society. And for Europe to become a beacon of social innovation, European leaders must understand the challenges of a connected and collaborative world and have to give users “voice and choice”. As <a href="http://www.charlesleadbeater.net/">Charles Leadbeater </a>explains in his recent book, <strong>“we are what we share”</strong>. That’s why the <a href="http://www.socialinnovationexchange.org">Social Innovation Exchange</a></font><font face="Times New Roman"><a href="http://www.socialinnovationexchange.org"> </a>is an excellent platform to learn about innovative experiences across the world. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman"><strong>From "Next Rev" to "Notre Rêve"</strong></font>

<font face="Times New Roman">“Social Innovation - The Next Rev” was the “motto” of the Lisbon International Congress. Discussing this compelling concept with the Portuguese First Lady Maria Cavaco Silva, a big supporter of the third sector in Portugal, she told me social innovation should be not only the “Next Rev”, but mostly “Notre Rêve”. And we don’t need to wait to make "our dream" to happen.  </font><font face="Times New Roman">On a connected world, all of us can make a difference.  But we should do it together, in collaboration. As Geoff said, <strong>“all of us are smarter than any of us”.</strong></font>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>What do thought leaders achieve ? Has this person saved a life, or invented a product that does anything ?

Is it enough to work in No. 10 ? Does the speaker think they have changed people's lives in the same way as a teacher ?

If you as a class of kids, do you want to be a thought leader, would they think yes ?</wp:comment_content>

<title>One-to-One Computing: Is this the Best Option for Learners?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is  link to a point of view recently published by the IBSG education team on which comment and critique are most welcome. <a href="http://www.theconnectedrepublic.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/cisco-point-of-view-on-one-to-one-computing.pdf" title="cisco-point-of-view-on-one-to-one-computing.pdf">cisco-point-of-view-on-one-to-one-computing.pdf</a> 

It seems to me that computing policies are too often made without reference to a sound model for education trasnformation that will really prepare learners for life and work in an increasingly global society. There are many commentators who talk about the fact that learners are hyper-social animals who want their formal education to embrace their world of connectivity and social networking. They talk about the need for changes to the curriculum, the way it is taught, the way it is assessed, the spaces in which students learn. Seymour Papert started the debate in 1993 with his book <em>The Children's Machine</em> and many others like Marc Prensky have taken up the baton. 15 years later little has really changed. Schools my be more liberal, more group work happens in places and the tasks students undertake are more interesting and varied, and there are pockets of excellence, but to all intents and purposes whole systems have changed little.  Maybe they can't change?  Maybe the political will and public perceptions about what schooling is and should be are too strong? <a href="http://www.nec.ac.uk/info/news-item?news_item_id=100437">Charles Handy </a>commented that "education is prone to a fifty-year time lag, as those who manage it have to prepare young people for experiences two generations removed from the world that they grew up in".  Do we have to wait for two generations then before education catches up with the other transformational changes already happening in the world? ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A year ago the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> government created a new ministry called the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. Its dynamic and progressive Permanent Secretary (Ian Watmore, previously the UK’s first Government CIO) wants the department to be innovation by name, innovation by nature and he is trying to drive this forward in terms of the slogan “Ministerially-led, customer-driven”. That set me thinking …<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the private sector being customer-driven or customer-centric is easy to understand – the aim is to make money and therefore doing everything you can to delight your customer makes obvious sense. In the public sector it is not quite so straight-forward, since objectives are more multifaceted and there are lots of different types of “customer” (many of whom might more naturally be called stakeholders). The simplest cases are where the public sector is genuinely delivering a service (usually to a broad cross section of the population), for example, supplying a passport or enabling people to pay their income tax. Here being customer-driven seems relatively unproblematic; the main difference with the private sector is that a judgement has to be made about the level of resources that should be devoted to delivering a basic level of service, whereas in the private sector this is determined via the pricing mechanism. So while as customers of the passport office we might want all passports to be renewable within 24 hours, we might as taxpayers accept that the basic renewal service should take 21 days with a premium service being available at extra cost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p>However, in other areas the position is more complicated. Consider the area of support for the unemployed, to what extent should that be customer-driven? Here it seems to me that what should really drive a department's actions are the underlying public policy objectives. So if the objective is to maximise over the long term the percentage of the working age population who are economically active, this should be the primary criterion against which your specific actions should be tested. However, this limits the extent to which policy is customer-driven. The fundamental question is not “Are we providing the kind of support our customers - the unemployed - want?”, but “Are we providing the kind of support that is effective over the long term in getting people into work?”. Of course, the two questions are linked and no doubt a major barrier to the public sector achieving its outcomes has been a weakness in listening to and understanding the various stakeholders it is trying to work with, but I do think the public sector risks getting confused if in its efforts to improve its interaction with stakeholders it forgets that fundamentally it needs to be objective-driven rather than customer-driven. Public policy should engage with the whole body of citizens; rather than focussing exclusively on a particular subset of the population that is seen as most directly affected.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I think the other aspect of DIUS’s slogan is equally interesting and I would argue that being more genuinely ministerially-led probably involves a clearer (and hopefully more transparent) contract between ministers as policy decision-makers and civil servants as policy implementers. At the moment we have a situation where ministers are theoretically responsible for everything that a department does, but where clearly a lot of the decisions are not really made by them – either because they literally do not know about them or because they had some knowledge of them but not to the extent that they can reasonably be held responsible for them. (“Surely minister you remember paragraph 10 of the 8th submission you read on the car home from the House? It contained an oblique reference to the fact that if you endorsed the recommended policy there would be some adverse impacts for groups X and Y?”). An alternative approach would to limit the number and type of decisions that were ministerial made, but precisely in order to ensure that the direction of policy was be more clearly and more firmly ministerially-led. So ministers would be responsible for setting clear policy objectives and making high-level resource allocation decisions and the most important strategic decisions on policy implementation. While civil servants would be responsible for working with “customers” (and other stakeholders) to deliver these objectives within the ministerially set resource constraints.<o:p>
</o:p></span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Interestingly, this might lead to two rather different sorts of consultations – consultations by ministers on the overall policy objectives and the best strategies for achieving them; and consultations by civil servants on the details of how best to achieve what ministers have said they want. The former would naturally be oriented towards the wider public, while the latter might to some extent be more targeted in customers/stakeholders. Moves in this direction would significantly change the dynamic between ministers and (part of) the civil service – civil servants would need to take more responsibility for some aspects of implementation, while ministers would have to recognise more realistic constraints in terms of their changing demands of those seeking to deliver their policy objectives. Ideally, of course, this new system would also involve a lot more transparency, so there was more awareness of what ministers had sought to do and the constraints they encountered. Would innovation along these kinds of lines work? Would ministers feel disempowered or would they feel more genuinely in control? Would civil servants feel empowered to stand up and deliver or would they see it as just a more complicated form of the status quo? I am not even absolutely sure what I think but I do think this is an area that is worth exploring and I would be interested to hear what others think. <o:p></o:p></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Is this sloganeering (and clearly, sometimes a slogan is just a slogan) or is there a new accountability regime being implemented?  Is Ian trying to send a message to his Minister and perhaps others?  He's a smart guy and this seems somewhat trite on the surface, so what game is afoot?   At a time when many Public Service entities are struggling to attract and retain new or experienced hires, is this a message that positively resonates with prospective employees, let alone citizens?  If an entity is Ministerially-led and customer-driven at the same time, does that mean the Minister will be in their portfolio long enough to learn about their customers?  Lots of questions, adding to yours...I find the slogan both fascinating and disquieting...it'll be interesting to see what if anything comes of it.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, actually I was a civil servant, but this is the title of a set of <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/iam/codes/social_media/participation.asp" target="_blank">principles for online participation</a> the UK Transformational Government minister Tom Watson has just published. Writing some clear simple principles that will give civil servants the confidence to participate on the web in the right way is a really positive move. To the outsider it may seem a straightforward task, but it is easy to imagine the internal obstacles this project must have run into (from the lawyers of course, but not just from them!), and it is great to see that they have managed to be short (only five principles), simple and positive. But of course they raise many issues.

One issue relates to the fifth principle, which runs “remember that you are an ambassador for your organization. Wherever possible, disclose your position as a representative of your department or agency”. This seems fair enough, but it suggests you can make a clear distinction between the work-you and the private-you, and yet one of the features of Web 2.0 (and blogging!) is that it undermines this sort of distinction. Isn’t Web 2.0 about getting away from a world where any message from an organization has to be a marketing message, dependant on (and reflecting) the top-down line to take? Isn’t Web 2.0 about being more authentic and hearing what real individuals really think and feel? To be a bit unfair, would you believe an HM Revenue and Customs civil servant who cheerfully blogged that things were never better with his organization and that morale was sky high? Or what about a Whitehall official who wants to contribute to discussions about transformational government but as an expression of her own personal experience and views rather than as an ambassador for whichever department she happens to work for? Surely that should be permissible (or even encouraged) as long as it is conducted in a reasonable way (no betrayal of confidential discussions or comments clearly likely to bring her employer into disrepute)? I do not think there are any easy answers here, but I do think that we will gradually need to move towards a world where we can be more mature about handling these issues and give public (and private!) sector employees more leeway to express their real views and their personal views.

I suppose what these points bring out is that the principles are really designed to allow civil servants to participate online NOT so much as bloggers but as official contributers to discussion fora. So the principles seem to be mainly about enabling civil servants to enter a tax forum and flag up to people that a new piece of departmental guidance has been published or that the discussion is based on a misunderstanding of tax principles in that particular area or departmental processes etc. This is a worthy aim and I certainly agree that the government needs to explore every avenue both for getting its message out there and for understanding what sort of response that message is getting. However,  I am not sure whether this is really going to take the form of legions of civil servants hacking through the jungle of the blogosphere for discussions where they can throw some light in a judicious, ambassadorial way. In fact, the whole thing conjures up very old fashioned images for me – one can almost sense the civil servant adjusting his bowler hat as he formally announces that he is a civil servant and cannot comment on all the issues being raised but would humbly like to point out one or two facts about departmental policy and process.  Won’t all the forum participants respond – you are not a civil servant, you are a human being! And then they will start asking him what he thinks of his departmental policy and process - at which point he will probably have to beat a discreet retreat. Anyway, I do not want to be negative and I think these principles are a great step towards government engagement with the Web. I do hope, however, that in ten years (or five?) they will look rather quaint.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Hi Paul - I heard about these yesterday at a discussion group I went to with Martin, et al. I did find them quite useful actually. As a Museum blogger sometimes I really do have to remind myself that I do represent my organisation and stop and think before I post things to either my blog or our various Facebook pages and YouTube channel.
The Powerhouse Museum has a set of principles for blogs and we had a bit of a discussion about them <a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/dmsblog/index.php/2007/04/23/powerhouse-museums-official-blog-policy-april-2007" rel="nofollow">here</a>. They are also a bit better than the BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/advice/personalweb/" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a> which are really restrictive I thought.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>It's all evidence of the "making it up as we go along" syndrome that much of the collision between Web 2.0 and the public sector is generating.  What these guidelines suggest to me is the larger issue that looms behind them, which is how public servants should engage in the more conversational aspects of the public policy process.  

This is a probem off-line, whihc is why it's a challange online. How should public servants engage with the outside world other than in the strictly formal and often entirely inappropriate ways that Paul's comments suggest?  Is it possible, as a matter of theory, to assume that public servants can have discussions with those outside the government in a more conversational style - exploratory, contingent, possible with mistakes or at least saying things they would like to change or amend?  

This is the blog world, as Paul rightly says.  It's about being authentic, which means being more human.  But the minute a public servant says something in this context, which remains within the proper bounds of politeness and not bringing the government into disrepute etc, but which is then pounced on because it has a nuance that someone can inflate and use against the government, for example, then presumably all bets will be off.

To me, this whole debate is about the way we set up the rules of engagement between public servants and the outside world so that they can be more engaged with, and perhaps even learn from, that more conversational, authentic but messier and uncontrolled world.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another muse from Kevin Kelly...

<a href="http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2008/st_infoporn_1607">http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2008/st_infoporn_1607</a>

<strong>"Never mind Web 3.0:</strong> The next stage in technological evolution is a single worldwide computer. Collectively, we are already assembling this megacomputer from our billions of Net-connected PCs, cell phones, PDAs, and the like. As an increasing number and variety of devices are lashed to one another via the Internet and other communication systems, they form the components of what we might call the One Machine.

Its circuit board encompasses the million copper wires and radio connections linking all the chips contained in the gadgets in your pocket, office, and car. Instead of being powered by a mere billion tiny transistors, as your typical personal desktop is, it runs on a billion PC chips, each with its own billion transistors. Its memory is the collective hard disks and flash drives of the world. Its RAM is the sum of all memory chips online. Every second, a Library of Congress worth of data flows through it. The program it runs — its initial OS — is the World Wide Web."

<wp:comment_content>Being lashed together is not the same as being One Machine.  In a very Wired way, there's something very powerful lost in some oversimplification here.  A simple example:  my phone has 4Gb of storage.  That's the best part of 4Gb more than my last phone had and has some very positive consequences, mainly to with the fact that I now generally don't bother to tote a separate MP3 player around with me.  That's fine for me, but I am not sure that there is any meaningful sense is that the One Machine is any more powerful as a result.  

Looking at the figures, a clear majority of each category of analysis is taken by personal computers and mobile phones - both of which are, in terms of the One Machine, dumb terminals rather than contributors to global device power.

Of course there is something big and powerful going on here.  The fact that I just checked the numbers by looking at the Wired website rather than bothering going to the room where I put the magazine down yesterday is a trivial sign of just how the world has changed from the perspective of not very many years ago.  Slightly less narcissistically, I wonder how many of those PCs and phones are primarily (or, in the case of the phones, even secondarily) used as network devices of any kind.

So I think the one-ness of the machine is to be seen in more granular - and so more interesting - ways.  My home PCs now back themselves up (through a splendid and near-invisible service called Jungledisk) to Amazon S3 data storage.  I am completely confident in the resilience of the data despite - or perhaps in part because - I have absolutely no idea where the backups are physically.  Google's approach to spell checking is more interesting, if still not as useful, as its approach to search.  Easy access to crowd-sourced stock photography means yet another industry is being disintermediated from a revenue stream based on scarcity of information.  And so on.

One Machine doesn't quite capture all that.  Perhaps we need another word.  Network springs to mind.  Or perhaps, since there are many networks, many of which are inter-connected, we should call it, I don't know, let's say, The Internet.

But that would make it harder to argue that all this is quite as new and surprising as Kevin Kelly would like us to think.  And then what would poor Wired do?</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Well...my vote goes to "laugh", however, I might add the word "nervous" in front of it...there's no way that devices attached to The Machine are equivalent to dumb terminals.  The fact that whatever you do on them (their underlying functions) can increasingly be controlled or modified by someone other than you, means they are far more than mere viewers into the Machine's world; the Machine then actually controls their function, purpose and evolution (not to mention what you might choose to share, for how long, for what purpose and with whom), effectively taking you and all of us along, perhaps and more likely, probably, without our express or full understanding...not meant to be as sinister as it might sound, but not something to blithely toss off and not for Kevin to wax romantically over...</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love the wealth of tools Web 2.0 has to offer and in an interesting sign of the times this week I joined two different Web 2.0 public sector collaborative groups. One arose from a European Union workshop on an e-government vision for 2020. Here the group went for <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>, which I had not used before and was glad to try. The other group was set up by the UK Department of Innovation Universities and Skills. They went for <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> from 37signals, again a new platform for me, but it seems pretty cool.

If this trend continues (which I expect it will), we are likely to see an explosion of these sort of groups (interestingly using commercial sites outside the firewall rather than internal tools), but it is going to be hard to sustain lots and lots of such groups, since no matter how interested you are in how transparency can transform the public sector, you are unlikely to trek round 10 different groups launching, contributing and learning from ten different conversations on this issue. I think that this is one argument for making as many of these groups as possible very open, so people can cross-post and link etc rather than making multiple entries or contributing randomly.

It is also pretty clear that we all face a learning cycle on this - particularly those who are setting up these groups and sites. The temptation is to think "I can create a really cool place everyone can come to" and to forget that increasingly people will have a bewildering large number of cool places they can go to! We are certainly going to need tools that make it easy to aggregate all these conversations in a convenient way. Obviously RSS is a big part of that, but the Ning group I mentioned above does not have an RSS feed because Ning do not offer this for private groups, while the Basecamp group does offer an RSS feed but because this is authenticated (to preserve the privacy of the group) it does not work with my Google Reader and so I had to set up NewsGator (which I do not like as much). So still some way to go, but at least the public sector seems to be embracing Web 2.0.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I had an interesting meeting with a large innovation UK local authority who felt that they (and other public services) needed to embrace radical reform or face the prospect of having to run ever faster in order to keep still. Their worries reflected the budget crunch that most UK public sector bodies are having to deal with. But their main fear was that as incomes rise, the demand for public services rises too only without a corresponding increase in citizen's willingness to pay the taxes necessary to fund them. This point is most obvious in the area of healthcare and personal services (especially for the elderly) but it also applies in education and probably to a certain extent in most service areas. As our houses become more luxurious, we probably also expect our streets to be better maintained and cleaner, and as we jet off on foreign holidays we are probably less tolerant of any transport delays or high costs that we encounter on our way to them. So what should public sector organisations do?

The authority I was talking to were keen to embrace innovative direct provision models - couldn't some of this demand be met directly by the private sector? I think the answer must be "yes", but it is obviously not a magic solution. One of the key questions is who pays and if the answer is the public sector, then this innovation is still about meeting demand more efficiently and effectively rather than deflecting it. For example, in the personal support area giving people individual budgets rather than providing a public sector service can give people more choice, increase the range of potential suppliers (from one!) and lead to more finely-tuned provision. So citizens may get a much better service and potentially that service may cost less. However, what we are talking about here is clearly meeting demand for public sector services in a new way rather than reducing it.

What this authority really wanted, however, was "cost-less public service provision", by which I assume they meant the market satisfying citizen demand that would otherwise have to be met by the public sector. I do think there are some opportunities here, but it is not an easy area. To some extent public bodies can use the fact that we are now in a more connected world to encourage specialised micro-markets that previously would not have been possible and whose absence does put pressure on the public sector. For example, as far as I am aware, the travel industry has not yet developed products for carers in need of a break from their caring duties. This (small) customer segment undoubtedly has specific needs (e.g. a holiday package that includes provision for the cared-for person being left at home or accompanying the carer) and if a market developed to meet those needs, some carers would no doubt take up the offerings and this would have benefits for the public sector (no need for the public sector to provide respite care, longer continuation of the non-state-funded caring solution etc). So there is a role for the public sector to play in encourage new (micro) markets to develop and thrive.

The difficulty, however, is that purely market-driven solutions will not meet a lot of the current demand for public sector services unless our current provision models change in ways that will not be popular with voters (or therefore with politicians). Direct market solutions are only likely to thrive as we move away from free public provision to provision where at least some charge is made. Furthermore, moves in this direction probably mean different levels of provision, i.e. basic service (which would be free or for a nominal charge), premium service, premium plus etc. Against this background, there would be plenty of scope for the market to compete with the public sector (or for the higher levels of service to be provided directly by the market without a subsidy). At this point the problem of increased income leading to higher demand for public services would be eliminated but only because citizens had been educated to expect to pay for those services rather than received them free (or subsidized) from the state.

The other area that is also worth exploring in this context is how citizens can do more for themselves on a self-help basis. So rather than trying to move services from the public sector to the private sector you also explore what the community sector might do, leveraging the fact that connectivity makes it easier to bring people together. I think this is another important element in the puzzle of trying to reduce demands on the public sector. Unfortunately, I don't think any of this means that the public sector will ever be able to get off the efficiency treadmill (which is probably a good thing). Nonetheless it is vital that they explore innovative ideas about how the market and community sectors can help reduce the speed at which the treadmill is turning.]]></content:encoded>

<title>The changing nature of work</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In response to a request from Open Forum, a public policy discussion forum in Australia, I posted a short piece on the changing nature of work and the way in which Cisco enables a more flexible and distributed workstyle...

The full post is at <a href="http://www.openforum.com.au/content/working-smarter">http://www.openforum.com.au/content/working-smarter</a>

This is the start of it...

The nature of work is changing and consequently we're witnessing a proliferation of workstyles that reflect new demands for flexibility, balance and autonomy. Organisations in all sectors confront the need to respond urgently to a bunch of demands that include the ability to work in less predictable patterns of time and location and to work in new and more complex patterns of collaboration and co-presence. 

Some days you need to work on your own, some days you need to work with a team of people who are all in the same physical space and the next day you need to work with team members who are all on different continents. On top of that, people are juggling professional ambition with personal commitments to family and community. Maintaining personal good health and looking after the health of the planet are dimensions of life that can't be conveniently forgotten or pushed to one side in the face of work demands and routines that are physically, emotionally and environmentally unsustainable.

So what are organisations going to do? 

My experience, fuelled by eight years' experience working with global networking and communications leader Cisco Systems, is that new rhythms of work are evolving, responding to these complex and sometimes contradictory demands, enabled and sometimes accelerated by new communication tools and information management capabilities. What is emerging is a simple challenge - making it easy and reliable for workers to stay connected to their work, to their colleagues and to their customers anytime, anywhere. Putting in place the platform and the tools, not to mention the culture and practices to make that outcome a reality, is much harder.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm attaching a short piece from the MIT's Technology Review entitled "How Obama Really Did It".  The piece explores the Obama campaign's phenomenal success with their web and online strategy, which apparently promoted Clinton advisor James Carville, of the famed "it's the economy, stupid", to paraphrase his own quip with the network now as his focus...

A few interesting hints from the article:

The Obama team put such technologies (Web 2, collaboration etc) at the centre of its campaign

The campaign did not micromanage but struck a balance beween top-down control and anarchy

They made giving money a social event...

You have to make the web tools central to the campaign and properly manage the networks of supporters they help organise

I get Obama's tex messages (says David All, a Republican media consultant)...it is never pointless, it is always woth reading and it has an action for you to take.

The piece claims we'll never see political campaigning the same again.  That might be true but the more interesting question for me is how Obama and his team, if they lay claim to the White House in November, translate the campaigning impact of the network approach into the same kind of shift in the way we do politics and policy.

Footnote - I watched the Obama acceptance speech from the Democratic Convention on YouTube last night.  The speech lasts about 45 minutes and had been watched by almost 300,000 people (that's in less than 2 days).  And remember you don't register a YouTube 'hit' as I understand it unless you watch the full clip...]]></content:encoded>

<title>Government Data and the Invisible Hand</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My Cisco colleague Richard Allan introduced me to a paper from Yale entitled "Governmnet Data and the Invisible Hand".  Worth a quick read.  The burden of its central message is that governments should stop setting up websites and start the less sexy, but ultimately much kore useful and revolutionary work of providing reusable data. 

Basically the authors suggest that in an age of relatively easy and cheap access to the tools of mash-ups and online forums, governments should spend much less time organising and presenting their data in ways they assume people want (and which mostly is done to reflect that goverment agencies themselves want and deem to be important) and much more time making the raw material - government data itself - easy to find, access and re-use.

This is the final paragraph of the paper:

"...we have proposed an approach to online government data that leverages both the American tradition of entrepreneurial self-reliance and the remarkable low-cost flexibility of contemporary digital technology.  The idea, though it can be implemented in a comfortably incremental fashion, is ultimately transformative.  It leads toward an ecosystem of grassroots, unplanned solutions to online civic needs."

It can sound a bit arcane and technical, but the impact of the idea from this paper might make this the biggest single thing governments could do to usher in the era of so-called "government 2.0".
